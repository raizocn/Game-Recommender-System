Rockstar has clearly but effort to even tiniest animation like opening a can of food or smoking a cigar. The story so far I really liked it.

Story is realistic and entertaining. And it works well with new multi-character system but too short for me. Shooter mechanics is okay and challenging if you turn off auto aim. (but don't expect RDR or GTA 4 mechanics) Game world is huge. But after 3 hours of gameplay it feels lifeless. Game map has no role on game progression. All parts of map are accessible. Almost all vehicles are presented from beginning of the game. And there is no more \"i'll unlock other side of the map\" motivation. Last and disappointing part of the game is driving mechanics. I think Rockstar tried to grab NFS and Midnight Club players with new car physics but i am out their scope. This game has too many casual design elements when compared to old GTA games. Non of these elements bothered me except driving. Driving the fastest car of the game nearly feels same as driving the slowest one (steering experience). If you're not obsessed with old game mechanics like I am, i guarantee you'll enjoy with this high quality experience.",

However, this game is not suitable for kids it’s only allowed for 18+ and over because it contains violence, drugs, sex, bad language and fear. However, the reason is because adults know this are bad stuff that they would not do in real life but on the other hand if a kid played grand theft auto it would learn and then do it which is bad. Also when you first start to play you have to complete a heist then kill the security guard then kill the criminals and head away with the money then after that it starts with the music showing Los Santos which is classed as LA in the game.  However, you can play with friends online and do heists together. But you have to be careful of your surroundings because yo0 could get killed every time by other online players. Also the game is made by rock star north. However, GTA is a single player game and you can play the game from a third person or first person perspective. Also the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest selling entertainment product in history, earning US $800 million on its first day and US $1 billion dollars in its three days. Also it has won game of the year award for being one of the best video games ever made by several gaming publications.

The Last of Us' influcence can't be overstated here for this game. You play as Kratos who's thrown aside his old ways and has traveled to the land of the Norse gods to start anew. You then set out on a journey of discovery with his son Atreus, who is a very well done and developed character in his own right. The story is amazing considering what Kratos used to be. His character development here is astounding and, for the first time ever playing these games, I really truly cared about him as the lead, instead of just being along for the ride of the first 3 games. And the story can be VERY long if you do all the amazing side quests that come with the game, which you definitely should. Upwards of 40-50 hours, depending on how quickly you move through the quests. It's a very good ride from start to finish and something I can't recommend enough.\rThe combat has been changed entirely as well. No longer a top down, beat-em-up style arcade game, this game has lots of depth to it. While the game's pacing at the beginning slows down everything you can eventually do, making the first few hours fairly difficult for new players, by the end of the game, you'll be smashing heads with the best of them. I'd say the only issue would be that gaining XP is very simple in the game and you'll have access to most of the talents fairly early on if you do all the side quests. It's very fun once you get the hang of it and I had a very good time with it.\rI truly never thought I'd see the day when a God of War game would become one of my favorite games of a generation but it's here. I'd say this has cemented itself as a top 5 game for the system and it'll be very tough for anything to top it. If you've got a PS4, go buy this game as soon as you can. I can't say enough good things about it and I really hope that the developers run with this for the eventual next part of the series.",

Firaxis/2K have really gone back to XCOM2 and created a 'special expanded edition' with new features, content and graphical style. The game is addictive, challenging and full of customisation options. It is fair to say that no two playthroughs in the world will be the same. However despite all of its efforts, the game mechanics and engine really struggle. Graphics issues are very common (even running on a PS4 Pro) and although not game-breaking can really break immersion. However the bigger problem lies in the games mechanics where the game will set up scenarios that are literally impossible in missions. For example in one mission where the task is to extract 'VIPs' by defending them from a horde of monsters, the game spawns a recurring villain right next to them. On the first turn he wipes them out, before any of your troops are even close. I have replayed this mission 10-15 times and I cannot find a way to win. What's the point of the mission? If it is to demonstrate the concept of 'impossible' missions, why not at least create risk for your troops? As it is, I can just evac my troops in turn two and fail the mission. OK I fail a mission and some bad stuff happens, but not enough to justify it as a design concept so the reality is that it is just a mistake on the game's part and that is truly disappointing.",

You might think you know a character after 2-3 sessions but you'll learn something that will change your whole perspective towards them.\r2. Deep Gameplay: I mean it's deep. It requires strategy. You have to make tough decision. The turned based aspect is simple to understand yet deep.\r3. Soundtrack: Sure some music is repetitive but after 10+ hours in the game you'll love to listen every soundtrack over and over again.\r4. World: High school. Different parts of the city, Metaverse. Velvet room with that music. Almost feels like you are there.\r Bad:\rIt feels a little repetitive in the mementos and when you save many enemies reappear. Very restrictive in terms of movement.

In fact, as a new comer, I may have had an even better experience with the game's story because I was not sure what to expect.\r After playing this game for over 150+ hours, you feel really connected to the teammates and they become almost real. The story is fun but has it's dark underlying tones that battle some problems that as a society we face today. From the everyday struggles of being a student to the sinister thoughts of those around you, be prepared to fight for the long haul.\r The artwork for Persona 5 is stunning. Amazing detail was added to even the smallest aspect of the game such as the in-game menus. Persona 5 really shows that games don't need to be realistic in artstyle to shine, and it really gives it charm.\r As far as the music, you must listen to it. Seriously. Acid Jazz really gets you into the vibes of the game, from the slow paced songs of the average day to the upbeat and amazing battle music (Especially when on the last day of a Palace, just me).\r If you enjoy any sort of RPG, you will probably enjoy Persona. As mentioned in the other reviews, it is a JRPG which means the battles are turn-based; perfect for any strategic thinker. Don't let the strategy turn you away though, Persona 5 comes with many aids to help out your battle plans and make it easier for anyone that does not want to finely control the battle experience.\r Overall I thoroughly enjoyed Persona 5, and I dare even say it has become my overall favorite game and experience and I highly recommend it.",

If you are a fan of RPGs, Persona 5 is a must play, it starts off slow, like the series does, but that slow start eases you in to things, and makes you that much more invested in what is really going on.",

                "review": "Metal Gear Solid V is a strange game to review. I love it so dearly, yet I am severely disappointed with it at the same time. It's one of the polarizing games I've ever played.\r At first I was in love with it, the story direction was a dark a unique twist for the series, and the gameplay is fantastic. So much mission variety, and the gameplay organically makes its own sense of creative fun. So many different ways to approach a scenario... that is for about 30-40 hours.\r The game offers 157 side missions and 50 main missions, which took me like 50+ hours just to get through most of. I still have another 40 side missions left to do. The grind gets insane. I feel like open world/sandbox games should be of a certain length, normally 28-32 hours is a good run for an open world game. This game takes 50+, and it overstays its welcome for me.\r I found the side missions to become a ridiculous chore, as they were cut/copy/paste 157 times over, meaning you go to every single outpost and camp to do a different goal. You get to know the 2 open worlds very well, because you will be grinding content in them for a long time. What's sad is when a side op takes you where the story will later go, so now you're familiar with all the hidden secrets, and the area doesn't feel new when the story goes to that place.\r The story is another matter. It is convoluted, yet barely even there. Big Boss rarely talks to give the \"silent protagonist\" feel, which was a horrible decision in my opinion, as he is already a developed and incredible character. The cutscenes were almost all shown off in the trailers for the game, and some of the really impressive and mysterious moments in the trailers were not as impressive in the context of the game.\r The story as a whole just feels cheap, and underwhelming. Without talking about spoilers, I will say that the ending is really poor. In fact, chapter 2 as a whole is just bad.\r Metal Gear Solid V is separated by two chapters, chapter 1 runs through mission 31, and I quite enjoyed that part of the game's story. The cutscene direction is really good, the only real problem I have is the pacing of the story is crazy slow.  However, chapter 1 leads into a totally underwhelming \"chapter 2\" which contains only 3 or so unique story missions.  And only 1 of those missions is remotely interesting (it's actually the most impactful mission in the game and I love it).  The \"ending\" is cut off.  The entire chapter 2 feels like Kojima directed some cutscenes, and was fired before finishing the second half of the game, so Konami dumped a bunch of padding in.\r In chapter 2, almost all of the main story missions are \"challenge modes\" of past missions, and they're so lazy that they even have you watch all of the old cutscenes as if they're happening for the first time.  These missions are fine if they were optional, but they are required.\r In the end, the gameplay and story missions of MGS V are a mixed bag between masterful, tons of fun, and a total grind.  If the story was planned better, and didn't fall apart in chapter 2, and if there wasn't LOADS of padding, I would give this game a 9 or 10 depending on how well it was handled. But I don't think this game needed to be the bloated mess that it turned out to be.  All in all, I had a good time as far as my enjoyment for a videogame goes, but as a Metal Gear game... I wanted a lot to be different or better.\r My score varies during moments of the game, so it lands in a range of 6-8.5, so I'll just give it a 7.",

Did Naughty Dog simply pick up the trashed scraps from the first 3 off of the cutting room floor and say \"Hey...  lets make this into a game and because we have a reputable name people will buy it?\"  So much effort into telling a story...  and little to no gameplay...  for the first 4 missions...  really makes this an attention grabber.  I mean...  they are still teaching me how to cover and shoot on the 5th level of the game.\r I am so disappointed in them for even producing this and they should be ashamed of it as well.  A sign of an awesome game is that it grabs you and is exciting and makes you want to rush home to play it...  and this game really lacks on both of these points.  I have played some really terrible games in my time...  but this one really ranks up there with the worst of them.  I wouldn't even rent this or pick it up at a garage sale for a dollar...  it is simply that terrible.

Undertale is a game that makes the player feel and think. It’s a game that fills the player with determination, and is most certainly one that you should play.\n                            ",

                "review": "On September 15 2015 the hit indie sensation “Undertale” was released by Toby Fox onto the PC platform “Steam” where it quickly grew in popularity and fandom. However by April 2016 the game seemed to have died out in popularity. Today people will tell you the game is complete garbage. But how good was the game? To answer I played through the game 3 times (one for each route) to see just how good or bad this game really is.\r When I first started the game I thought the lore was interesting: a world where humans and monsters once lived together but where the monsters were banished after a war in which the opposing kings lost their sons. I was intrigued by the art style chosen, an 8-bit sprite overworld, and during the dialogue and battle sequences a much more detailed (albeit still 8-bit) sprite, which looks absolutely gorgeous when animated. The tutorial is a bit bland, but the game kicks into high gear when the first boss fight (against the tutorial character conveniently named Toriel) If you kill her, you can go for one of 3 paths. The genocide route: the hardest path (It took me 1 hr and 23 mins to kill the final boss “Sans”) in which you kill every single monster programmed into the game. In Undertale unlike other games like pokemon, there are a finite number of monsters to kill. There is also a “Neutral” path, where players can kill as they please unlocking a different ending depending on the people they kill. And if you spare Toriel you can try for a pacifist route in which you don’t kill ANYTHING. If you beat the game in this fashion, you unlock a happy ending filled with all the monsters enjoying the sunshine for the first time in hundreds of years.\r Usually I despise monotonous 8-bit video game music, but I loved the Undertale soundtrack, it is mostly a fusion of 8-bit and other real forms of music like bebop, rock, and classical. It compliments the aesthetic perfectly and opts you to capture the moment of the game and just listen for a bit. The only thing I really didn’t like about this game is what remains of the fandom. The fandom of most things is bad enough, but Undertale takes the case with bad fan art and OC’s. If you say ANYTHING bad about the game like “I think the overworld art could have been done a lot better”. They will swarm you like wasps telling you how Undertale is a masterpiece and could do no wrong. Although this is honestly all I could come up with that was negative about this game.\rIn all honesty the reason this game is no longer popular is because the fandom killed it. Butt I believe if the fandom wasn’t so bad, it would be held as a classic. I have to give the game 8 stars out of 10. The stunning visuals, and great gameplay, coupled with a stellar soundtrack, and astounding story. However the fandom keeps this game from the 10/10 it truly deserves.",

It's indie, it's retro, it invites talk of \"subverting the conventions\" of its medium, and it is precious in its presentation. If you're a heinous bore, procrastinating on your postgraduate thesis, this game is aptly suited to accept the self-satisfied word salad you call an opinion.\r But it's easy to get distracted by the insufferable audience of a work, and that's not being fair. I actually do see value in subverting conventions: having the consequences of killing a character dog you even when you've reloaded a previous save, and the range of aggressive or pacifist actions you can take, offer some interesting perspective on the kinds of worlds that most games portray (where violent catharsis is the sole solution).\r I don't care much about any nostalgic element to the presentation, but I like that it's too low res for the disgusting anime styles of modern RPGs to be rendered, that there's no awful voice acting.\r The character development presented a satisfying enough blend of motivations and conflicts (though the game does get up its own ass a bit in this regard), and seeing the conflicted motives of the \"enemies\" play out in real time, within the battle mechanic was kind of neat.\r That mechanic, though...\r There are worthwhile experiments, and there are genuinely enjoyable experiences, and the primary mechanic for winning battles in this game makes it one of the former.",

                "review": "It is extremely satisfying to start seeing this type of old-school RPGs being released for consoles, with a very fluid control system that doesn't make you miss the mouse that much. The game is a marvel, I would not say it is perfect, but it is definitely bringing a lot of top-notch stuff to the table. It is obviously comparable to the classic Baldur's Gate as that is its reference, but the game experience differs quite a lot. The story here seems more disperse and it might be difficult to relate to the playable characters as their context and personal situation is touched vaguely and briefly. You might only feel a connection 30 or 40 hours into the game, if you do at all. This wasn't the case in BG, where everything turned around you from minute 1 and that facilitated a more immediate immersion.\r So the world and lore will feel overwhelming and very disperse if you haven't played previous games in the franchise (as it was my case), but it definitely compensates that once you start realizing the vast amount of possibilities the game mechanics allow for, the interesting combat tactics, and the incredibly developed side stories and characters.\r The music is fantastic, the graphics are neat (although I recommend a very big screen, 50' or so if you're playing coop/split screen), and the gameplay generally fluid and intuitive. The learning curve is considerable but it helps that you only have a couple of skills to use for the first few hours. The auto split screen is a fantastic feature that I hope other games will copy soon, as it allows for an incredibly flexible coop experience.\r In conclusion, a must if you are into old-school, high quality RPGs and were dying to live such an experience using your PS4 controller instead of a mouse. Give it patience and the game will reward your time spent on it.",

With detailed texture work and lighting this game looks absolutely gorgeous. It's also butter smooth hardly ever dropping frames even when giant colossi are thrashing about. The story has been left untouched retaining the same emotional journey the original offered. No new colosi or extra story but Everything else however has been improved to the MAX. Bluepoint games did a phenomenal job of remaking this classic. ID even go as far to say this surpasses the original and is one of if not the best game remakes ever created. A masterpiece has been made even better i can't wait to see what bluepoint games does next. Absolutely incredible job. 10/10",

I got to level 27 out of 30 before I gave up on the trophy and the platinum, so don’t think with assist mode this is all of a sudden some easy platinum trophy because it isn’t… mount celeste is going to be in your way of it one way or another..\rsomehow nearly 25% of players have this trophy though, I don’t see how. The game must have only sold like 4 copies and  the one person that got it is a developer or their parents just didn’t love them.\rjokes, im kidding..\rim just not one of those people that think, you know what would be fun?\rdying over and over and over and over and over and over until muscle memory and luck prevent me from doing so,\rIts not my thing…\rthat being said I do again still see the greatness in this game, the brilliant level design, the brutal difficulty, the option to skip the difficulty and just explore, a great trophy list aside from the pico 8 bit..\rCeleste is a really great package for people that love retro games, stress, or trophies\rI give Celeste an 8/10",

The spirit of Resident Evil 2 has been distilled down, concentrated, and reconstituted into this beautiful, hideous experience that completely undermined all my preconceptions.

It eschews the horror-kitsch stylings that made the original games instantly memorable, cuts down the weird, and plays it entirely straight. It can be off-putting. It can feel too serious.

This often becomes problematic when your mid jump and all of a sudden you character uses their special power because yor thumb leaned on down ever so slightly. A frustrating design which could easily have been resolved by mapping it a different button.

Oh btw it's four player co op, so now you have a reason to have that second controller.\r I can't judge on remote or crossplay, this wasn't tested and the maximum characters I played with was 2.\rIt was an interesting dynamic with two people in some of the levels. As you can disrupt each other by attacking and you can kill the other character by going to far ahead, if this sounds bad don't be put off as death isn't permenant, and if both players die it's just a restart.\r I also like the unlockable characters and the fact that you don't spend 10k lums on a character if you have 10k lums you unlock the 1k, 2k, 5k and 10k characters.\r Can be enjoyed best with a friend.",

To ensure the player keeps pace on these levels is a triumph that only Ubisoft seem to be able to pull off at the moment.\r In a world of shooters, sports games and RPG's, going back to platformers and making them better than they have been for many years is brave, but when you pull it off and create something as enjoyable as Rayman Legends, the risk is well worth it.\r I hope this isn't the last Rayman game that Ubisoft produce, the gaming world needs you Rayman!",

If you like Platinum games, you can enjoy the combat, though it is not as good as the Bayonetta series, it's not as bad as the Korra game.\r Where the game truely shines is its narrative. The game uses the works of philosophers like Nietzsche to tell the story and serve as a backbone for its core themes. While they don't provide any interesting commentary on the works they reference, very few games even attempts on tackling this subject matter and they actually do some quite clever things to its narrative and gameplay to invoke the works they reference. The game ends with the most interesting moral choice in video games ever. I won't spoil it here, but I will say that unlike other games where a moral choice usually means you see one of two endings, this is a moral choice with actual consequence on the player making the choice.\r One main gripe I have with the game is the character design of 2B. I'm no prude, but I was disappointed that with everything else about the narrative of the game being so well thought out and deliberate, that the only justification the creator had for 2B's sexualised design was that he likes looking at hot girls. This is a rather shallow design choice as it sacrifices both realism and characterisation.\r On the realism front, there is no reason to send a battle android into battle in a dress. It offers no protection and later on you see that they could have put her in amour the entire time, they just chose not to.\r On the characterisation front, 2B is portrayed as a cold, aloof character that is actually emotionally vulnerable and caring on the inside. Again this is not reflected in her character design as nothing about a skirt suggests cold on the outside, caring on the inside. Again a suit of amour would have fit in better as it alludes to the fact that her cold exterior is just a defence mechanism to help her not get too close to those she cares about, but if you get past her emotional amour, she is vulnerable.\r With everything else being so well thought out, the decision to put 2B in a skimpy outfit seems like a missed opportunity.",

The puzzles in Fez are quite well balanced, ranging from the simpler platforming puzzles needed to complete the story, all the way to extremely cryptic brain crunchers for the completionists. Fez also tells a neat little story through its world, if you're observant enough to pick it up, and observant is what you'll have to be if you want full completion of this game. I cannot recommend Fez enough, whether you just want to relax and play a stress free platformer or if you're looking for a deep puzzling challenge, Fez just keeps on giving.",

The story is boring, nothing really good. There aren't many characters, and when there are you don't care about them too much because there is little dialogue. The gameplay is pretty annoying past the begining of the game. While the platforming and puzzle solving is fun I have two problems witht the gameplay. First, the secrets and even some of the levels were really hard to find for me. I don't know how other people found them, but I don't like having to search for stuff for a lot of time, and that is what this game is making me do. Second, there is no fast travel so to get from one location in the game to another is a painful experience. Playing this game feels like a chore, having to travel from location to location looking for rooms, cubes, and secrets you missed. The game is much more enjoyable at the begining, where you are just exploring the levels. For that fun exploration, I do reccomend it.\r Overal: 6.5/10",

The bosses will kill you a lot but like any good souls game from the past, conquering that boss that has killed you for hours will feel amazing and will give you a rush that simply cannot be felt from many other games. Where Sekiro falls a little short for me is with its prosthetic tools. A lot of them are far too situational and some are just not really worth using as it may get you hit if you try to use one and when you get hit you lose a lot of hp in this game.

The game is in short very grindy which is the appeal of the game as well as its multi weapon system that lets you choose any weapon of your choosing to mix up your play style. The game feels very multiplayer heavy, you can of course play by your own absolutely, but the fun is playing with your friends and taking down monsters as a team,that in itself is both a positive and a negative. while playing with friends it makes the monster a little more difficult to beat as it does synchronise with the amount of people in your group, but on its negative side you do all share deaths which means you will be punished for having a bad team member apart of your group. this also affects the matchmaking aspect as you can be paired up with very bad players and constantly fail quests which can leave you frustrated and wasting time,the 3-5 hours you may have free every day if you work a job may in fact feel pointless if for all that time you constantly fail quests because of the team you are put with making you feel as if you wasted all your free time achieving nothing.\r The gear is also one of its let downs as well as the hub. The hub area made us believe that it is where players will be put to hang out as well as meet other players in the game much like a game lobby with random players, but unfortunately that wasnt the case, it is only for the specific party you are in and you can only be seen if you all choose to go to that area to meet up. The most 2 tragic things is possibly its gear, although the gear looks very beautiful and unique,there is always 1 or 2 gear sets that benefit a specific weapon so when you obtain the best gear you can expect the player you meet that use your weapon to have the same outfit you are using which makes us feel less unique,instead of giving us the choice to look however we wanted and still keep the stats on our gear the company used microtransactions where you can get cosmetics to give yourself a unique look without effecting your stats.This should have been a feature in the game as it has been in a feature in the series before it ive been told, this seems like something they used to exploit the fans and players and is very unfortunate to see. The last point is also about the grind and yes there is alot of grind to be done here,you will find yourself defeating the same monster over and over and over till you reach a point where you can read its every move ahead of time.  one simple feature here should have been made so after you defeat the creature,whatever part you carve is the item obtained for example if you carve on the tail you get a tail material of the monster. i dont think carving at a monsters head 3 times and obtaining 3 tail pieces was a smart move to make, i do know the game is based on grinding but there has to be some reward that makes you feel good,even if it was made every 3 times you get to select a piece for your own as a reward regardless of what it is.\r The game is not at all terrible and there is fun to be had here especially with friends, but its not something i can not downright say its a must buy for anyone,there is only a specific group of people that would enjoy this and that is very unfortunate.",

                "review": "Back when I played Borderlands 2, I noted that I loved the humour and the writing but couldn’t be bothered with all the comparing of loot, the respawning enemies and the other ways in which the Borderlands franchise conspired to be a massive time-sink. Thankfully, Telltale Games took the cheeky, satiric and violent sensibility of the franchise, kept the great writing but poured it into their interactive storytelling model, focusing on words rather than weapons. The result is one of their best games, a comedic scifi adventure romp which calls to mind Guardians of the Galaxy.\r The Telltale formula will be familiar to most gamers at this point. They tell interactive stories that change depending on your input. The games are split into about five chapters which are released with a month or two in-between each chapter and together these form a ‘season’. Most likely, you will end up with a complete story, but find the door left open for a sequel. Tales from the Borderlands sticks tightly to this formula. Compared to the The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones entries, it very much eases up on life-or-death decisions and focuses on humour. The illusion that you are really affecting events in a major way is pretty thin here. You’re mostly sculpting emotions and influencing the tone of the characters. There are multiple variations of each scene, but you’re being led down a narrow path.\r Thankfully, the dialogues and characters will quickly hook you. Even if the overall structure of the Scifi-Western world they inhabit doesn’t make much sense, you will gladly suspend disbelief to join them on their adventure. You play as two characters. One is Rhys (Troy Baker), a disgruntled corporate lackey who has a score to settle with his boss and the other is Fiona (Laura Bailey), a grifter who together with her sister and her sorta-dad pulls off swindles to get by. There is an overtone of screwball comedy to the script, so you may expect them to get together romantically, until you realize that would mean playing two sides of a romance, which would end up feeling silly. However, what the writers do instead – pushing you towards a romance with Fiona’s sister Sasha – isn’t much less awkward. You’re partly playing as Sasha’s suitor and partly as her sister, which is an odd combination. It wrongfooted me and made me miss the first cues about what was being set up.\r Speaking of romance, the Borderlands franchise has always been pleasantly inclusive of lesbian and gay characters in an admirably casual way. It continues its streak here, encouraging players to bring bad-ass fighter Athena and her mechanic girlfriend closer together. It is still all too rare for a franchise to be this inclusive without making a fuss about it.\r More than with any previous Telltale game, you will want to replay scenes while making different choices. Not because of the impact on the plot, but for a chance to catch all the one-liners you inevitably missed the first time around. Some of my favorite jokes revolved around the two robotic allies who end up tagging along with you. They have some of the best dialogues, such as when one of them, caught gossiping about you to the other robot, drily defends himself by stating “I cannot hold back the tide of your bad decisions”. There is also a very sly and expertly executed visual joke – set up almost accidentally it seems – referencing R2D2 and C3PO.\r As always, the advice with Telltale’s games is to not play chapter by chapter, as released, but to play the whole season in one or two sittings, like you’re reading a good book over a weekend. That way you catch all the nuances and callbacks to earlier episodes. But if you only play one Telltale game, this is definitely the one to go for, even if you don’t know the Borderlands universe yet. Some in-jokes may go over your head, but you’ll still be laughing. @PopCultJunk",

The story doesn't pick up from where the wild hunt ended, more acts as an addition. A small portion of the map opens up for exploration with some additional markers to seek out and more monsters to hunt down, but back to the story. The unparalleled storytelling continues in this dark, deep and extensive expansion, it felt as good as the story in the base game and was better, in my opinion than some full retail games. A new rune crafting system comes into place which allows you to further enhance your weapons and armour; unlimited weapon enhancement time? Sure, armour that deflects arrows? Why not.\rBasically what I'm saying here is, you can pick this DLC up for £7.99 and it's as good as the base game was, albeit not as long, I managed somewhere around 20-25 hours all in but for that price, it' an absolute must for anyone who owns The Witcher 3, it would be rude not too.",

This game looks like an updated  Mario 64 I thought and wasn't anything special I wrongly assumed watching him play the levels. The next day I tried the game out and was blown away by how great this game is when you put on the headset and exprience it for yourself. Everything in this game is pure fun , the catchy tunes, the stunning graphics, clever gadgets and variety of levels and enemies. Every level is unique and quirky and you're driven on to see what the next level is.My personal favourites - and beach level which goes undersea and a spooky level later on. This is not just the best VR game I have played but the best platformer in my opinion. A great showcase for VR- and just pure fun",

Games like God of War and Spider-Man were excellent but they felt a little like playing great looking versions of last gen games. Astro Bot makes you feel like you are playing a video game from the future and it honestly made me feel like a kid again. The graphics and sense of scale are incredible. The controls are perfect. The main levels are brilliant, the challenges are fun, and the boss fights are epic. There is a ton of content for a $39.99 game. This is easily my favorite game of the year. A must buy game for any PSVR owner and one of the 10 best games I've played this generation.",

It gave me some of the same vibes as the Half-Life series, and that's a great thing. The relationship between main character Jack Cooper and his Titan BT is surprisingly heartwarming as well. Multiplayer doesn't disappoint, either. The gunplay is tight, map design is excellent, the weapons all feel satisfying and useful, the different modes are diverse and interesting, and the Titans are easily the best killstreak ever conceived in an FPS. The fluidity of movement works just as wonderfully online as it does in the campaign. Respawn has also delivered support for Titanfall 2 long after launch. At the time of this writing, updates have stopped, but since 2016, Respawn has added in several multiplayer maps, weapons, a new Titan, and an entire co-op survival mode all for free. The only paid DLC is cosmetic and not based on RNG lootboxes. Everything you buy you know in advance what you're getting and this should be applauded. Respawn are one of the last ethical developers to exist and they deserve praise for it. My final score for the game is a 9.5, but I always round up, so it's a 10 from me. My only complaints are that most of the boss battles in the campaign are rather dull and easy and some of the spawns in certain multiplayer modes can be frustrating at times. Other than that, I love everything about this game. The fact that more people didn't buy it is a shame. But, if you're still interested in 2019, Titanfall 2 can be had for dirt cheap and there are still thousands of regular players online, and more have trickled in due to the success of Apex Legends. Do yourself a favor and check this one out. You'll be glad you did!",

Now I bought Titanfall 2 simply because I've seen the hype and I was bored and in the gameshop.\r The added single player story is a great addition. While it isn't a mind-blowing experience it is actually fun to play through and does the job well of introducing some lore into the game, that many feel was much needed. I've actually been reading up on the lore because of it - something I never thought I'd do!\r Multiplayer is very fun, face paced and has that 'just one more round' feel to it. Even though is 4am and you have work ion 2 hours you just want to keep going!\r I'm looking forward to future updates and hopefully some more story to go with it. Definitely worth a try if you are into FPS games",

Now to give that game its proper due, the graphics and atmosphere are both fantastic, and multiplayer is massive to say the least.  That said, I couldn't get into it for some reason - and didn't feel like I was having that much fun playing it.\r With that, I went ahead and did a straight swap for Titanfall 2, even though I didn't have high expectations for it. Long story short, I haven't regretted that decision one bit, as TF2 is possibly the best console fps games I've played. The movement, speed, and gun fights remind me a little bit of Quake 3 Arena - which was absolutely frantic and tons of fun (from my PC gaming days and the old mouse and keyboard combo).\r If you're still wondering which game to pick up, this'll hit the right spot if you're looking for something fast paced and fun.

While the combat has a bit more fluidity to it than Dark Souls 2 it feels more stiff and unresponsive than Bloodborne and still has a jankiness to it.  The combat seems to be meant to be slow paced (and everything I've read agrees with that) but there is a strange delay to the combat actions that is present in all games that I imagine stems from an issue with the engine From Software uses for the games.  While the atmosphere and look of the levels, armor and bosses is generally good to excellent the graphics seem like last gen.  This wouldn't be an issue but even with low grade graphics the engine still has FPS issues in certain places.  Also while this is heralded as a \"difficult\" franchise it still does not even deliver on that promise.  It's a marketing tactic used to sell a glitchy and low effort project.  Why would From Software bother to develop a proper working combat system, current generation graphics, a cohesive and well-told story (sorry the off hands approach in the fashion they use doesn't work and whats there is uninteresting at best), a proper RPG leveling system and progression, bug fixing and any other thing that would be included in a well-developed game that focuses on quality when the game will sell with the bare-minimum effort put in.  I wouldn't really recommend this game for anyone, and for trophy/achievement hunters willing to play anything (like myself) be prepared to put in a long grind to get your trophies/achievements.",

I was sceptical first, I wasn't a big fan of other BRs, but i gave it a try like everyone else. And holy **** its addicting.\rApex got some great takes on the Battle Royale Genre overall, specifically the great gamedesign including a ping system which is a first-of-its-kind. You can fully communicate with your squad, randoms or friends through this system. Next great thing is the balance of the game. You feel like every weapon is viable (except maybe Mosambique) and every Legend or Hero is contributing to your playstyle. There is nothing 'OP' in this game, everything is useable.\rOther great thing are the graphics and atmosphere. The world and every character is crafted with lots of details. You can feel the personality on each Legend and you can customize your Hero how you want with various skins, poses, stats and badges. You can build your own \"legacy\" with each Legend because your stats and badges are fitting to the one Legend you played.\rIf you win a game, you get appreciated through being the champion next game. So everybody knows who to look after and can see you on different big posters throughout the map. It gives you an extra rush seeing you on a big screen hanging there, visible for everyone.\rOnly a few deaths are really getting you to rage, normally you'll rage a lot but through clever design choices with armor, HP and TTK you have the chance to win every gun fight and even win games when you are not the biggest 'aimer' in the world.\rOn top of all that, it got released in a finished state and is free to play. The prices for the premium currency are more then fair and only thing you can buy are cosmetics, no pay to win what so ever.\rThe only big bad thing for me is Origin. Origin is just not working, lots of issues with connecting to friends, to the game and to a lobby.\r You see, I am a big fan of this game. No game got me that addicted and no game feels so good.\rEven if you dont like Battle Royale, this game is nothing like PUBG for example. GIve it a try, trust me.",

Unlike other BR games, you play as a hero (in this case, Legend) with 3 abilities (1 passive, 1 active and 1 ultimate). The max amount of players is 60. The game's unique feature is the ability to respawn teammates even if they are shot down (provided you grab their banner and bring it back to a respawn site). The ability to ping anything you want to (enemie positions, loot, directions to an area, etc.) with R1 is very useful. The game runs at 50-60 fps on PS4 and feels twitchy. The core gameplay is a mix of CoD Blackout and Titanfall, you can frantically run and slide and climb walls just like in those games. The game has launched successfully, but it has issues.\r This game is very tough for solo players. You are forced to play in squads of 3 people (there is no solo mode at the moment), and if you haven't brought friends to co-ordinate with you'll be at a big disadvantage vs everyone else playing in a squad with teammates and comms. The frantic pace of the game means there is no room for being tactical, it's more about run n' gun. The current roster of Legends is horrible. But the ultimate sin is that 2 of the currently available Legends (Caustic and Mirage) are locked behind a paywall or a lot of grinding.\r At least Apex Legends is free to play. There is an in-game store selling 100s of cosmetics and skins. Thankfully there are no pay-to-win loot boxes so far. The real issue is you have to pay to unlock new Legends, and this may prove to be pay-to-win depending on their ability kits.\r Apex Legends has been a big success thanks to Fortnite and PUBG's previous success. The game is good, but Respawn need to address the issues.",

Although I prefer the setting and setup of Heavensward, Stormblood has various twists and unforgettable moments, I'm excited to see where the story will unfolds in 4.x patches.\r - Gameplay:\rThe two new Jobs (Samurai and Red Mage) are AWESOME. Tried both of them a lot in Palace of the Dead and they play very fluidly with interesting mechanics. Red Mage in particular seems very enjoyable to play, they got the jack of all trades role right. While Samurai is pure DPS monster with zero utility to the party, skill wise it is a bit harder than other melee DPS since you have to keep track a lot of things. The battle system changes they introduced is also mostly a success and make old jobs more streamlined (a bit dumbed down, but understandable, WoW had worse skill pruning).\r - Music:\rNo comment needed here. Still reign supreme as the best MMO music.\r - Endgame:\rCan't give full impression on the endgame since raid is not out yet (2 weeks from now). The only endgame content currently is 2 Extreme Primal which I haven't tried yet.",

Bastion is a simple game and those who can see that it is one of the best simpler games in today's time. Comparing Bastion to triple A games and calling it a weak entry is just like calling tiramisu a terrible tasting steak. The music is top notch, comprising of a wide range of folk styles that blends into the pace of the game as well as the environments perfectly. As opposed to emotionless full 3D CGI models, the art style of Bastion is simply beautiful, when was the last time you have seen so much color in an action game? The character designs are sleek and somewhat of a 'Jungle Punk' feel to it. Speaking of the characters, straightforward is what I would call them, there is no need for complex backstories cinematic because, guess what? I want to play the game rather then watch it. Enemy designs are very cool as the narrator pretends that you are well versed in the lore of this world already, it never breaks immersion. The few flaws are so minute that they don't even warrant a point off the User Score. Yes some enemies take too much firepower to bring down, and there is no exit when you accidentally fall asleep, all these are just small issues that barely affect how enjoyable this game is.",

However the gameplay is so one dimensional that it drags the overall package down; you do nothing but kill things over and over in the span of 5-7 hours of gameplay for one playthrough. There are no platforming, puzzles, or different mission designs. It makes the game hard to sit down and play for more than an hour at times, it just gets too repetitive. I also didn't care for the story, so it didn't impact me emotionally at all. If played in short burst I loved it, just wished there was more diversity in game play. It's a simple top down 2-d beat em up/ hack and slash that is fun and polished, with some rpg elements. If I could score this game based on general gameplay alone it's an 8, but as an extended overall package it doesn't quite have the same effect. Final verdict: liked it but didn't love it.",

A new direction -- an open-world with bright and fancy graphics and gameplay to coat that delectable Bioware RPG storytelling that is such a rarity in the modern gaming generation. One would expect a lot from such a game. Instead, we got an experience that is a jack-of-all-trades and master-of-none.\r Combat seemingly felt the heat of Frostbite, with the ability bar being reduced from all the abilities you can possibly hope to use in the game to a measly eight slots. While this may seem a small change, one can quickly see the consequence: the combat is MUCH faster. Having so little skills to choose from, cooldowns are kept low. This effectively renders the already clunky tactical camera a pointless feature, as you will end up smashing the same buttons over and over again with no real thought put into how to approach a given situation. This doesn't even highlight the fact that the often wide-open terrain that an open-world lends itself to, does little to add tactical flavor that the series is known for.\r The environments are varied and beautiful in their own ways, even by contemporary standards. Yet, while these would be nice to look at, one will quickly discover the lack of any real content within these picturesque landscapes. Meaningful objectives to make the areas feel alive are few and far between, with boring MMO-style fetch quests being all too common.\r And, perhaps the most disappointing of all, the story itself falls short as well. The central plot struggles to make itself feel important in the grand scheme of things. The subplots that surround it are nice on their own, but I couldn't help feel as though the threat that was supposedly lingering underneath the surface was an annoying afterthought rather than the impending doom that it should have been.\r The characters serve to salvage a rather lackluster story. While not necessarily the best cast in a Bioware game, it was one of the most stark reminders for me that I was playing a game by that studio.  Characters develop, have emotions, goals, and motives -- often making it known should they disagree with your decisions. While not necessarily as nuanced in interactions as in Dragon Age's previous two entries, it still makes for a pretty good bunch of characters to adventure around Thedas with.\r In the end I must say that, for Bioware, it was a let down. I went in expecting to return to a world that once made me want to stay by virtue of its fascinating story and interesting gameplay. Instead I got a middling story, barren countrysides, and lacking combat all with a nice paint job. It is still a well put together modern fantasy RPG experience, but for a game that was trying to be at the pinnacle of that mountain, Dragon Age: Inquisition leaves much to be desired.",

Having it take place in a time period that is often not touched by developers is a welcome change of pace. It has a decent amount of content to keep one invested, and the two map packs that recently came out change enough to make them good, if unnecessary editions to the game.\r In terms of graphics, the game is gorgeous, and often times looks like it could be photo realistic. There is some minor issues with character model glitches but other than that it is still fantastic. The sound design is great as well, with all the guns sounding like they have real firepower behind them.\r The gameplay is also very good, though a bit arcade-y. Being able to drive and fly in vehicles from the time period is great, and the shooting is a lot of fun, but the prevalence of automatic firearms is a bit odd considering the time period wouldn't have that many and mostly had bolt action rifles. The spawning of vehicles and planes from outside the map is also something I'm personally not a fan of, as I like having the vehicles on map to get in at any time. But the overall gameplay is fun and is challenging enough to make you want to come back.\r The Campaign, or \"War Stories\", are an interesting addition. Most of them are pretty well made, having a good production value behind them, though I feel like focusing on only 1 of the campaigns, and making it longer and have better character development would've been a better idea. The lack of any campaign for the central powers was also a missed opportunity, especially considering the rather \"Gray\" nature of the first World War.\r Overall, it is a fun game and a nice addition to the Battlefield franchise, and I think we will see a rise in shooting games from the world war period again due to its success, and nowadays, I think this will be a welcome change.\r 8/10",

I've played many open world games, and other than the Witcher 3, they all bore me to tears after a brief period of time.Also, as great as Guerillas last series was (Killzone), lets be honest, story and exploration was not a strong point of those games, so it would seem unlikely they would pull it off here. My expectations were shattered. This game has me sucked in! The world is absolutely fantastic! I actually want to talk to every NPC, follow every dialogue path, explore every nook and cranny because I am just so damn engrossed by the world that Guerilla Games built. For the first time ever I have a desire to find all the collectibles because I love finding  small tidbits of world lore that gives me a bit more of a glimpse into what happened to this ancient civilization and what is happening to the games protagonist, Aloy. I haven't yet beaten the game, and this may just be the honeymoon period, but at this moment, I am just twitching to get back to Horizon and find myself another ancient ruin to explore or bandit camp to clear. This game truly is worthy of all the praise it can have heaped on it, and is my favorite game so far this year.\r Pros\r-Engrossing world\r-Gorgeous graphics\r-Fantastic combat\r-Fun collectibles\r-Fun side quests\r-Writing, for the most part, is quite solid\r-Great RPG like mechanics breaks up the normal grind that games like this usually suffer from\r Cons\r-Voice acting can be a bit iffy sometimes (including rare bits of awkward writing)\r-Hopefully the story keeps at the same pace and doesn't give away too much too early, not really a con, but could be!",

                "review": "Okay, to be clear, I'd prefer to give it a 9.5, but MetaCritic only does whole numbers and it deserves better than a 9, so I'm rounding up.  This especially feels fair, considering all of the fake 0 votes.  I just reported SEVEN duplicate 0 reviews, and who knows how many 0's are written by people who aren't so lazy to cut-n-paste?\r I've platted and 100%ed the game.  That means that, unlike a lot of reviewers, I've seen all of the lore and had a lot of opportunities to put 2+2 together and figure out the more subtle aspects of the story, not to mention recognizing a lot of the real-world mythos the author(s) drew from and the skill with which I believe they did so.  I think the story is far deeper than most people realize, but if they don't know all of the details, I won't fault them for thinking it's shallow and even a bit nonsensical at times.\r For instance, there's all this extreme ethnic diversity that just seems like an SJW agenda, but it turns out there's a very real and convincing reason for it.  If you don't play far enough to learn about it, you're going to have a very different opinion about the game, I'm sure.  But I assure you, whether it was done as an SJW move or just part of the story and seemed to be one, I think it won't bother you when you understand it.  And, trust me, such SJW moves bother ME and this DID bother me until I understood.\r There's also a reason why Aloy, voice acted by the talented Ashly Burch, seems to have a very flat affect.  You would expect better from her, and it turns out you're right to expect better, and indeed you got better than you realized.  You just don't realize it until you understand why from the later parts of the story.\r I take off that half point for two reasons.\r One is this business where the lore is too back-loaded and people are going to drop the game sometimes long before they understand what's really going on.  Some might never really even think about the lore enough to realize what I think makes it so good.  So that's a storytelling failure.  I don't think the story itself is flawed, but in some respects the storytelling is.\r The other is the extremely-inconsistent lipsync and the far-too-subtle expression of emotions.  There are times when the lipsync and the expressions are excellent and you can tell they were capable of very good work, but most of the time you get the distinct impression that it was just left to automation to try to sync and infer emotions, and the results can be really dismal and immersion-breaking.\r Really, though, I feel the combat is excellent, the story overall is excellent, the world-building (meaning the universe, not the physical world) is excellent, the graphics are stunningly-well-executed, the option to be an explorer and ignore the story is there, and some of the characters are hilariously memorable (I give you the name \"Brin\" and leave discovery to you).  I can't realistically honor all that with less than 9.5, so 0.5 is all I'm willing to take off for the bits I mentioned above.\r As an aside, I own all consoles and I have no allegiance to manufacturers or publishers.  I wouldn't tear down, e.g., Breath of the Wild, to make HZD seem better.  Both are great games with a few minor flaws, and that's the worst I'd say of them.  I think people who tear down this game to do the opposite, to make their favorite sound better, are the cancer of game reviews, and I hope I've justified my scoring enough not to seem like one of them.\r Anyway, try it.  I hope you'll like it as I do, because I'm very happy to have played it.  So much so that I cranked up the difficulty, turned off the UI, and immersed myself as well as possible for a second playthrough.",

The aesthetics of combining a primitive world with futuristic machines looks really cool and the graphics blow me away! The game makes you feel you are all the time inside a picture and it’s actually a nice feature they included a very complete photo mode.\r The game has some flaws too, like the fact that I didn’t really feel very connected to the characters and story.

                "review": "This game brought me happily into the world of roguelikes.  Let me rephrase: Binding of Isaac did, this is an expanded version.  This game doesn't boast an entirely new game.  The game's creator was very vocal about Flash limitations, and this game has been given the creative space and development capability that the creator wanted all along.  Along with over 400 items, different endings, a number of different playable characters, and secrets that are worth trying crazy things to find make this game a blast through-and-through.\r Imagine The Legend of Zelda, but take out the world map, and you complete dungeon after dungeon.  This is the core gameplay of BoIR.  You may see the term roguelike a lot in reviews, and this solidifies the game.  Pickups, enemy drops, and each level is entirely random.  Some games you'll die in the second room, others will leave you playing hard to the final boss.  You will find the game unforgiving and death is permanent, though your unlocks are not.  If you die, you start back over on a new run.  Death is unforgiving, but each run is typically no longer than an hour at the absolute most.\r The graphics continue the style of BOI allowing a filter to keep it foggy and pixelated or clear and sharp, depending on your liking.  The environment isn't as engaging as BoI, but it is appropriate to the game.  It is a dark game, fighting demons, angels, spewing blood, and destroying piles of dung.  Definitely not your average game, but still very much the style that BoI players have come to love.\r I have both the PC and PS4 version, though I haven't noticed any differences except that the controller makes the game slightly more difficult.  I have begun opting for using X, O, Square, Triangle for shooting rather than both sticks.  With some item synergies, you may find that tapping to shoot is easier, but tiring, and forget about swinging the stick to shoot in those situations.  This game is mostly enjoyed on a keyboard, in my opinion.\r Beyond that, Rebirth took some great steps in terms of item synergies.  In the old game, you often found yourself overlapping items rendering them useless, but this does a much better job of incorporating different bonuses to Isaac.  A welcome touch.\r This game can be replayed over and over, and should be, for alternate endings, new items, and a host of players with different pros and cons (Cain being my favorite).  The new co-op option is small but welcome, allowing new players to be recruited at the cost of a heart, and though they can fly, Player 1 is still in complete control of the game.  This could be helped out by a few different tweaks, but it is still fun to throw your buddy a controller and play through.  There were some glitches with this, players disappearing but still able to shoot and live, but other than that, I have had great playthroughs with almost no hiccups, though I have noticed some graphics stuttering from time to time, but that seemed more attributed to behind-the-scenes.  It did not seem like this was due to screen clutter or bullet hell and I found the game very smooth overall.\r Replayability is the best thing that BoIR has going for it.  Death is permanent but short, and picking up again is always beneficial.  Many items are unlocked by what seems to be external counters, spending x amount at slot machines or blood banks, so even if you can't see unlock counters, you are always benefitting from a playthrough.  There is also a great new mechanic in the form of a playable character with completely random, but balanced, starting loadouts and stats, but you can only play as this character for each time you beat the game.  Though I'm not sure the exact benefits of this, I know that it will unlock some cool features.\r This game is great, addicting, and simple-but-fun.  Without the need for connectivity, this is a great fallback game when your internet is down or when you just want to play a good old-fashioned side-scroller.  I have a blast playing every time.",

I came into this game not expecting game of the year quality just a little fun to past the time and be optimistic with a newer style of game. It certainly did surprise me the amount of enjoyment I got from such a simple concept, this was due to random changes in map and abilities acquired with every single play through.\r My first couple of games I couldn't really grasp what to do due to minimal instructions set by the game, but I guess that led to mystery as an overall. The certain aspects I enjoyed was the different variety of boss battles as I thought that a boss was advocated to certain level etc. I love the different array of powers also even if some are rendered useless its like a lucky dip you have no clue what is until you pick it up. It took me over 3 hours to complete my first play through due to trial and error and the certain difficulty the game possessed, as the enemies get progressively harder each level.\r I rated this game an 8, which I seem is a fair rating. As i'm basing it on a rating I would give it if I purchased the full game for people who didn't get it for free in the month of November 2014. Things I found tedious wasn't really a game mechanic but the luck system they implemented, by that I mean finding a level with a tinted rock (stones that contain items) and not having any bombs or explosions to get it, usually on the first level. One more thing but this is technically a positive; but when I unlocked Azazel I never needed to use any other character because he was so overpowered (You'll understand once you use him)\r Defiantly a game worth purchasing especially because its FREE! It's a game that reminds of games of the past and how the gaming used to be before the commercial mainstream FPS's etc. overall this game is epic and I thoroughly enjoy playing it as something different\r Thanks for reading my review of The Binding of Isaac:Rebirth PS4\rBibleThump\r Ninjo",

Getting into what's great (and stuff which is not so great):\r Pros:\r*Story: An incredibly twisted, thought-provoking and moving story, which really starts to unravel itself in the most unique way through subsequent play-throughs. As it's a Yoko Taro game, expect a lot of dark moments.\r*Combat: Fast-paced and super satisfying, plus it changes up with each character you play.\r*Boss fights: This game has some of the most creative and crazy boss battles you will experience!\r*Switches genres: Go from a third-person to side-scroller to bullet hell to mini-arcades to other game genres I didn't even know existed. But it is all seamless and addictive!\r*Soundtrack: The music of the game is phenominal and really adds to the narrative and the big story moments.\r*History and lore: At first, it might seem there isn't a lot to the open world, but as you progress and unravel the hystory and mysteries of this dystopian world, there are a great many surprises and easter eggs to discover.\r*Uses the medium to its fullest: Nier Automata is a wholy unique experience, because it likely wouldn't work in any other medium other than as a video-game…that also a Yoko Taro game.\r However, just as everything, the game isn't perfect and has few technical faults.\rCons:\r*The difficulty is broken: even while playing on normal, the game is at times incredibly easy and at times excruciatingly difficult.\r*Jaggies: the graphics are incredibly jagged and takes some getting used to.\r*Open world is not so open: there are a number of invisble walls (in places there shouldn't be) and gets to be a bit frustrating to navigate at times.\r*Ranged attacks: the combat mechanics of the game is awesome, however, you can find yourself relying too much on the range attack function in situations, that it becomes more of a crutch that takes away from the awesome melee combat, especially in difficult boss battles.\r All in all, Nier Automata is an incredibly unique and riveting experience, the likes of which will stay with you long after you have finished it.",

Where’s the graphics? Hello. It’s 2017 we have 4k consoles. Terrible, horrible graphics. This is just a very cheap indie with a tiny budget ripping off the naive. I bought it and am asking myself - where’s the game? It’s just a demo. The rogue element is to save production costs so you think you’re getting 60 hours of gameplay but you’re really playing  the same game 10 times with a slightly different ending.\r After FFXV all male game with females as an afterthought and this absolute rip off I’m keeping away from Sqaure Enix cash ins.

Your can buy it at most gaming  stores or online. Nba is the perfect game to play if you are a basketball fan and just love basketball.   You can play online in myPark and play against other people and make new friends. There are also other game modes too for example there is blacktop and myLeague or myGm or myCareer. MyCareer is the way you level up your player to go online. So if you want to have fun and play basketball Nba2k17 is for you.\r Nba focuses on one category for the game modes and that is myCareer. In my opinion they did a amazing job with myCareer, you get to experience what it like to be a true nba prospect, like going through college and getting scouted and even getting drafted! There are cutscenes that let your interact through the whole story mode. You even have a girlfriend and you have to choose whether to pick the nba or her. You can customize your character too, Like you can choose what he wears and your can even customize his personal look.\r Nba Has some cons though too. Some of the bad things is the servers to play online modes are super slow and very choppy. In Mypark You lag out of the parks and your end up playing the best people on your consoles . I wish there were levels and each level brought different people. Nba has a lot of glitches too, like when you're dribbling the ball might go through your defender and the same thing might happen on the other end to you too.\r Overall Nba2k17 is an awesome game. I recommend this game to all ages and hope that your have fun playing this game and hope this review helped you. (:",

It improves on everything the original did, and adds new ways to play the game through the addition of a new playable character and stat tracking for each mission and playthrough as well as overall.  This hasn't been talked about much, but it makes it much easier to know if you've ruined a ghost playthrough before the end of a mission.  Missions are much longer this time around, and the level design is at times stunning, and always engaging and rewarding.

Having beat the first installment I was thrilled to play the second. I was not disappointed. The story is a classic revenge tale that we've seen a thousand times before but with a twist. The developers saw fit to allow us to choose which perspective we wanted to play the game from (Corvo or Emily). I chose to play as Emily as it felt like that's the way the developers made the story to be.\r LEVEL DESIGN: The levels are each very unique with so many secrets that you'll spend all your time searching every little nook and cranny to make sure you didn't miss anything. The environments are vibrant and feel very lively.\r ENEMIES: The AI in this game is actually better than I expected. The enemies really react to everything you do and are not your typical wait-to-be-killed stock characters. The difficulty they present will really challenge you to use different approaches to each area.\r STORY: The story is engaging enough to make you want to play through it. Its by no means the best RPG story but it is more than serviceable. The characters are well developed and each have vital roles to play. I was surprised by how interesting the in-game world was. There are numerous documents to read to further flesh out the backstory and enhance the experience. The best new thing was the fact that you can go through the entire game without killing anyone. This plays into the stealthy approach that the game has and I liked it.\r CUSTOMIZATION: The weapons are similar to the first title with a lot of new powers and the chance to craft your own unique bonecharms. I found this to be particularly interesting when I came across two or three bonecharms with traits that I wanted to fuse into one bonecharm. The level up mechanic is also pretty cool to play around with. It encourages exploration which I enjoyed a lot.",

beginning of the game, customization is pretty basic so you’ll be lucky to get a character to match your likeness even a tiny bit\rThese source hunters are out to solve a town murder, but while solving this murder they’re sent down a path and realize they need to solve something much larger than this.\rBefore you play this game, you need to be self-aware with the kind of gamer you, because while this game is fairly new, the way it’s delivered isn’t.\rDon’t expect a top down Skyrim…\rI was reminded many times of Pokémon, in the sense that every city you go to has its own story that still connects to the main story.., you set out on a journey and that’s it, you’re on your own, see you later or never, the game doesn’t care.\rIt will not hold your hand, other than marking the occasional few important places on your map for you to go check out\rThis is a 60 hour journey that you’ll need to figure your way through.\rAnd the only way to do this is to listen to the conversations…\rAt first this doesn’t seem like too much to ask, but every character you run into talks longer than your mom does when she bumps into somebody she knows at a grocery store,\rI’m almost certain 15 of the 60 hours was spent sitting through dialog..\rYou can skip through any and all, but this isn’t advised as again, it’s the only way you’re going to figure out where to go to next,\ryou have to literally immerse yourself into the game world to beat it... you have become your character…\rThat being said, if you don’t have the time or patience to literally almost live another life you’re not going to like this game….\rSure you can follow a guide, but who wants to do that for 60 hours?\rOtherwise, you’ll find this game to be quite the masterpiece\rYou’re solving mysteries and puzzles, there are side quests that can help with main quests, tons of npcs to interacts and trade with, and you want to talk to every npc, helps them, get on their good side and sometimes be able to bring them along your journey..\rTheir help is much welcomed because outside the city walls the wilderness if full of enemies ready to kill you\rBeyond the problem solving that’s going on, there is a turn based combat system here…\rThis fighting system is very simple to understand with tons of skills and spells to learn based on your characters skills that you get to freely choose as you level up...\rYou could easily turn a brute to a witch and vice versa….\rThrough shops, chests, and bookshelves, you’ll find tons of skill books to teach your characters new moves for battles…\rYou have your basic elemental attacks which come in handy since enemies do usually have a weakness, and the environment is completely interactive…\rYou can catch things on fire, blow them up, throw poison grenades, it’s all fair game...\rMy favorite though is the ability to summon creatures to help you…\rBy the end all 4 of my characters could summon at least 1 creature, while only 1 of the 4 were a witch…\rYou aren’t forced to stick to certain skills based on your characters stats... there is an insane amount of freedom here…\rStill, it took me a little over halfway through the game to get my team so stacked... so for the first half I had to rely a lot on scroll, which can be used to regenerate a fallen member, summoned creatures, or do elemental attacks…\rI did however feel that I was a little too over powered in the last 40% of the game…\rI hardly had to think during battles..\rIt seems as though I’ve figure out the best strategy and it failed maybe 2 times onward…\rbut even the final bosses were a breeze…\rThis made the final few maps feel like a drag, and you kinda get to see just how repetitive the game real is…\rStill the first half of the game can be insanely challenging at times….\rsome bosses 1 hit killing your entire team, having to force you to approach their rooms differently so all of your member don’t take the damage…\rLuckily you can find some epic loot to help with elemental damage, give you some stat boosts, and if all else fails, there is a quick save feature to let you retry as many times as you’d like, or leave, stock up and come back…\rThe journey to the credits though is well worth it..\rEspecially since your characters feel so real to you\rThey will interrupt when they disagree with your dialog choices, causing you to have to rock paper scissors your way through a decision and this really an extra layer to the immersion..\rOF course even better if this other person is sitting on the couch with you, as this game does support split screen coop as well\rDespite feeling more like a puzzle game for the final half, Original Sin is one of the best RPGs in a long time.\rBut if you aren’t willing to put in the time and effort this game demands,\rI wouldn’t necessarily recommend it\rI give Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition\ra 8.5/10",

                "review": "Firstly, I am an old-school D&D fan, so the turn-based combat has a decided appeal (in an RPG the skill should be in the stats of the character, not in my skill with a controller). On the whole this is a pretty good game that will appeal to a niche market (jRPG fans should take note as this is a step up), but will unlikely find a wider audience given its mechanics and lack of polish.\r Pros:\rTurn-based combat that depends on every stat of the character, which is controllable/ determined by you...from who attacks first, who attacks most, through damage, defense, etc. Very satisfying...but takes a while to get back into coming off of the action style games of today.\r Character customization for the above reasons; allows vastly different approaches to the game.\r Crafting is strong; again, only if you are into the time it takes to appreciate it. This is another niche appreciation.\r Story is ok and although the physical footprint is not large, the combination of the above and the planing involved with approaching combat, so as not to be 1-shotted, the game takes 40+ hours to complete (maybe on easy mode it would take less, not sure).\r While I don't play co-op, that you can fully lay the game co-op is a fantastic feature.\r Cons:\rThis game was clearly made on a PC budget, from visuals to voice acting this is very obviously not a AAA product (again, much like a jRPG)\r Combat, at times, can be very unfair. It is far too easy to be 1-shot killed (not just \"you\", your whole party!!!!!) and, in a game with a true ironman mode, that is unconscionable.\r Rock-paper-scissors is a ridiculous concept to resolving disputes...and I mean ridiculous.\r Like too many games over the past few years, the games become more complex, but the tutorials do not, so your early enjoyment of the game is much less than it should be...and you lose a lot of people that are borderline RPG fans.\r Camera angles (top down)/ screen colors are not great and it is fairly easy not to be able to see enemies during combat as they blend into the environment (not purposely)\r Enemies/ creatures do not re-spawn, so there are only a set amount of xp in this game...once you are \"done\" a section, it is barren (except for the corpses) for the rest of the game...huge disappointment.",

I started my first game and made it into town despite not knowing what I was doing, but I couldn't move on with the main quest because despite doing everything I found in the walkthrough, I never got the option to make the arrest required for the story. Ok, fine. I'll start over, maybe I did something wrong, even though I looked up every guide I could find... This time I'll start with the right skills and it will be awesome!! Fast forward to the big orc battle outside town, I win and... wait, what? I can't even get inside the town this time?!? Ok, forget this game.",

On one hand, the faces are incredible, and the models look great; however, the attack animations are still an absolute disaster. You have to hand it to NRS, they have given you a lot of bang for your buck, but they are still botching the simple stuff. Also, the DLC characters have been pretty weak sauce (other than the TMNT). Ultimately, you have to ask yourself if tons of content really help justify a game that doesn't feel great to play. NRS is still behind literally every other fighting game developer when it comes to making a game that feels (and in motion, looks) good.

Part of it is pure nostalgia, sure, but although Owlboy looks like an \"old\" game, it sure as hell plays as a modern one.\r There is just so much stuff packed in this brief game. The 10 hours give (challenging) platforming, (sometimes challenging) boss fights, haunting soundtrack, great characters and a story that mixes mystery and charm, with a dash of sweet sadness. All that covered by a gorgeous pixel art and a gameplay mechanic that is part Zelda, part Metroidvania.\r I don't want to spoil anything, it would not be fair to other players - and especially to the developers, who took almost 10 years to make this game. Owlboy should be played, discovered, felt. it will give you all sorts of reactions; confusion, frustration, surprise, delight, wonderment.\r By the end of it, I was still trying to wrap my mind around the story and a weird feeling inside me; because I loved Owlboy. But... it also broke my heart. So, with a smile and a tear in my eye I said goodbye to this little indie gem that hopefully more and more people will get to know and love.",

I've played both PC and PS4 version of the game for more than 100 hours. The good news is - the PS4 version is on par with details and resolution with the PC version, it also has a decent amount of AA and not the most terrible FOV as well. The bad news - the PS4's framerate needs improvement badly.\rI hope this get addressed. Other than that - I have no issues whatsoever.\rIn summary, I'd like to say something which is more likely directed towards the developers instead of the game, but since I consider it very important in this day and age, I'd like to point it out. The game and the expansion are now sold for less than $50. Very good price for the content IMO. And lastly, the game was NOT available for preorder which is a huge point earned in my eyes by Croteam.

                "review": "If there’s an arcade genre that has stood the test of time as fun, it’s the twin-stick shooter. You know the games: Robotron, Smash TV, Asteroids. While developer Housemarque has been creating THE twin-stick shooter experiences since the 90s, it wasn’t until the HD version of Super Stardust that people really started to take note. While they’ve put out some other fantastic games like Outland and Dead Nation, the next game that really took the genre to the next level was Resogun. Housemarque is here to redefine the genre once again.\r Nex Machina was created with Eugene Jarvis as a creative consultant. If that name means nothing to you, note that he worked on several of the aforementioned titles, in addition to the likes of NARC, Total Carnage, and the Cruis’n series. Put simply, it’s hard to think of someone more attuned to the nature of arcade games. Pairing him with Housemarque is a dream come true.\r The game at first glance is strikingly beautiful, with an enhanced engine that was used for Resogun. While both are great looking games, Nex Machina stands well above the other. From the set pieces to the character models, and even the explosions of voxels, everything here is improved. Saving the humans is back, which creates a sense of urgency in each room as you introduce the enemies to your arsenal weapons. Of course, saving them is optional, but as is typically the case with an arcade game, you’re playing for the high score, and every little bit counts.\r In addition to the normal movement and shooting you’d expect, you also have secondary weapons in the form of pickups and a dash button. Dashing allows for movement without being damaged, which is useful as one hit will kill you unless you have a shield. And with a seemingly endless supply of enemies in certain rooms, on top of the near bullet-hell type gameplay, that dash is necessary for avoiding death. In addition to the shield that you can pick up, you will also find enhancements to your bullet spread, rocket launchers, swords, bombs, lasers and more.\r The difficulties are steep, although they are certainly fair. If you absolutely need to beat the game, but really struggle with deaths, the easiest difficulty has an unlimited amount of continues. The normal difficulty offers 99, while the hard only provides 10. Of course, beating the game without any is an option as well, but that will take the most dedicated of players. If you die in a room, you can learn from your past mistakes, as the AI will play out in a similar manner. Naturally, the way you approach it will change the way they interact. And humans are always top priority depending on the enemy, so you may want to take advantage of them being distracted before picking up the squishy life-forms.\r In addition to the obvious objectives of humans, killing all the enemies including the level’s boss, and not dying, there are many secrets to discover. And with the sheer amount of things going on in each room of the levels, they are easy to miss. You’ll be playing levels over and over to find everything the developers have hidden, and quite honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way. It provides more reason to go back to previously played levels other than beating your friends’ high scores, which is already plenty of reason in a game like this.\r Speaking of friends, if you have someone you like to play things with, this offers local co-op. If you think the screen is insane by yourself, just add a whole other person shooting bullets to the mix. Note that the co-op is limited to local, and it’s really no wonder as any amount of lag could lead to disastrous results. Even with a solid internet connection there are hiccups, and honestly, most people don’t have their systems hardwired to a high speed connection. It’s awesome that the option is available, and smart that they stuck with the couch.\r While the arcade mode is the game’s obvious focus, there’s also an arena mode that will task the player with beating levels under different conditions. Think of games that add certain handicaps while expecting you to still beat it. You will find many challenges in the trophy list, and they add so much to an already content rich game.\r The only thing left to sweeten the deal is the music. Ari Pulkkinen lays down some very heavy, trance like beats, which is par for the course with him. While it is what you’d expect, it doesn’t make the soundtrack any less mesmerizing.\r As always, Housemarque delivers with a game that is not only simple, but fun beyond compare. It’s rare that a developer is able to create new IPs that are consistently described as something that you’ll be addicted to the moment you play them, but that is undoubtedly the case here. Nex Machina is sitting at the top of my list for not only Housemarque games, but PS4 titles available right now. Strap in, get your thumbs ready, and make some voxels go boom.",

It has much of the same graphical style, most of the same game modes, but none of the same magic.\r Its well made, but rudderless as you fly through a rapid succession of meaningless stages which end with an undecipherable formula and a score that feels empty.\r Like Stardust Ultra or Resogun, i guess you are supposed to continue to replay the 5ish stages for higher scores ---then on more difficult settings for a more intense challenge, but its all so similar and missing a worthwhile end goal.....i just dont get why you would. There is so little opportunity for alternate play styles or strategies, it ends up being an almost identical experience each time.\r There are some achievements called \"feats\", and some slight customization you can unlock by grinding currency from certain modes.....but again, why? Do you care if your barely visible character has a slightly different highlight shade to his white outfit.\r I was looking forward to this game and preordered it, but after 10 minutes i was bored. I thought i had missed something. I played through each mode more than a couple times, hoping the game would grow on me....it didnt.\r It steals virtually all its enemy and even stage boss mechanics from Resogun, making it feel very derivative.\r In a sentence, Its Resogun without the novelty, PS4 launch limited competition, and charm.\r It will probably be a PS+ game by Xmas....save your money.",

But if on the one hand Nioh is called a copy, on the other it is called a renewal. I prefer to consider Nioh as a renewal because there are so many different ways of playing, it is difficult not to identify with a specific type of weapon or even the combat position.\r I'm not an expert in composition of art (animation and soundtrack.) But I would like to register my passion for Team Ninja's work in this part of the game, I really shivered whenever I heard new music while exploring the missions. As for graphics, I have nothing to complain about since I'm playing in action mode that works at 60 frames per second (I recommend doing the same, it's great.)\r I have not finished the game yet, but what I have seen gives history is excellent. It is incredible to be able to tell a story so rich in subtle scenes. The only flaw of the game so far are a few bugs I've witnessed, but that have not affected my experience with this excellent work at all.\r Finally, I leave here a maximum recommendation to those who love challenging games. Play this game as it will be one of the best experiences of your life within the game universe. For those who just want to relax, I strongly recommend that you do not buy because you will only stress more (unless you are a deity of difficult games). Everything in the player instigates me to improve, something that I consider obligatory in games of the type. Remembering that no one needs to take this review as a basis, I'm just a player leaving their opinion on a game.\r I wish good luck to those who buy, but be prepared not to do anything else until the end of the game.",

I constantly found myself wanting new gear and doing what I could to improve the stats on my current set.  Overall, I would strongly recommend it to any Souls-Borne fans or someone looking for a new type of challenge, but as well as it mirrors From Software, it doesn't quite dethrone the king.",

Some of the boss attacks are also cheap, spreading damage across nearly the entire screen. On the whole, though, this game brought back that Nintendo feeling.\r The fantasy Mexico setting is full of video game in-jokes. The enemies are incredibly varied, especially the bosses. The attacks are easy enough to employ, and even I, a button masher through and through, could pull off a few combos.\r The back tracking and boss fights did bother me both from a practical standpoint and philosophically. Practically, I don't want to waste my time running around the game world. There are teleportation  points on the map for faster travel, but this concession would be unnecessary if the game world was designed as linearly as the story. (I had the same complaint with the more impressive looking \"Dust: An Elysian Tale\".) Some of the boss fights also took too long. The bosses with timed, area of affect attacks are a throwback and work well with the retro-feel of Guacamelee. Some of the boss attacks, are too cheap and cover too much of the screen. The final boss battle is grueling, Maybe its my age showing, but I value the quality of the experience more than the quantity.\r Philosophically, I believe this game was made for the hard core gamer and those gamers are served well. For a casual gamer, such as my children, this game could be too frustratingly difficult. And it's not just the boss battles. Some of the platforming requires expert timing and precise button control. What will happen to this genre if all the games present a barrier to entry?",

And even though I haven't finished the game yet the story has been fantastic so far! It's so cool that they actually gave us a taste of what the story in this one was gonna be in the reboot's DLC! What a move! And the gameplay... oh man... its mechanics is the deepest I've seen in any hack 'n slash game I've ever seen! it's satisfying, it's hard hitting, it's intense, it's deep and it looks and sounds incredible! I would say if you are new to the series, it's still gonna be an absolutely amazing experience but you would miss out on some of the \"holy **** that's **** cool\" and especially the \"just like old times\" moments that only the fans will enjoy. And it's not like the previous games aren't enjoyable now! But I can't be unbiased towards them so I might be wrong! I've recently played the previous games again and had a ton of fun.\rIf there are any negative points even worth mentioning is the fact the I guess I would've like to see V having a bit deeper fighting mechanics and I would also liked to see Kyrie playing a part too... I really miss her! She was so cute and she was everything Nero was not! Also she was the most Japanese element of the game and sorta gave DmC 4 an even more unique feel to it. (I also liked Nero's hair in the previous one... again, it was more Japanese. But I understand they wanted to make the game just a LITTLE Cyberpunky so... I guess I understand why they made the hair shorter!)\rAnyways, enough of me talking. Just go ahead and buy the game for crying out loud! And if you're new to the series, don't be afraid of playing the previous games. Although if you're just after the story I'd say skip DmC 2013... even though the gameplay is **** fantastic!

Devil May Cry is that answer, and with the 5th installment out I can say I couldn’t be happier to see this series continue. Devil May Cry 5 is such a good game that meets the requirements of being fun and having a good enough story to keep you engaged and wanting more.\rThe story has you follow three heroes now during this apocalyptic demon invasion. You control Nero the hero from the 4th game with his brand new robo-arm instead of that boring old demon arm. You have new comer V who is if Hot Topic decided to vomit on my screen and that vomit transformed into a character. Last of course you have Dante who is… well Dante but now with stubble. The game manages to balance the three protagonists fairly without focusing on one more than the others. The way the story is told is also interesting taking a page out of Tarantino’s book and tell the story jumping back and forth until you get the conclusion is nifty and keeps you engaged. I dug the fact if you are new to the series you can still pick up this game and not be completely lost on what is happening. Let’s be real no one come to the DMC series just for the story they stay for the gameplay.\rThe gameplay is Devil May Cry at its finest. This game reminds you why DMC is the master of the hack and slash genre. Being that you have three heroes you probably wonder how they play? Each hero is very unique in how they are controlled. Dante being very similar to how you’d expect. Nero has many different arms now that keep the battles interesting and different with each arm. V is the most radically different being that he doesn’t necessarily fight himself in battle. During combat V uses familiars to battle so while you’re jamming on the triangle or square button you also must keep V away from any enemies because he is made of tissue paper and cannot fight. My personal favorite part of this game was the boss fights. Each boss is unique, and pose some form of challenge that I would get excited each time a new enemy would pop up just hoping for a boss fight.\rOverall I loved the hell out of this game. It was about a 12-hour experience that just melted away for me. This is the first game this year I have had a smile on my face the entire time playing. While I wasn’t the biggest fan of V as a character, nor as playing as him the game is still amazing. I cannot praise this game enough. I has been one of the best-looking games this year and best gameplay I have had in month. Capcom is doing great this year I give this game a HIGH HIGH FULL PRICE.",

Though not being the greatest player of turn-based strategy titles, I made it through to the end, and enjoyed every minute.\rI couldn't believe my luck when I discovered the sequel would be coming to the PS4. It was an instant-buy, no question about it.\rMy excitement soon turned to disappointment however, upon experiencing the harsh, unforgiving difficulty. It was then that I realized that this game was not designed for me, or indeed a wider audience of gamers. It has seemingly been designed for hardcore xcom players only.\rI looked at my \"Demon's souls\" platinum trophy in disbelief; this game is too hard. Way too hard for the casual gamer, or novices of the genre. Even on the easiest difficulty setting. There's too much stacked against you here.\rMy biggest problem is the inclusion of timed missions. Time limits in strategy games are never a good thing as far as I'm concerned. People want to play at their own pace. They don't want to feel rushed, or shoved head-first into a horde of enemies before they can plan or think. There's RTS's for that.\rI constantly felt outnumbered, outgunned, and outmaneuvered at every turn. Shouting at the television in anger as a 90% hit chance misses an enemy, yet again. I found myself constantly reloading my last save in an attempt to keep my soldiers from dying, but becoming frustrated as the lengthy load times here are an absolute joke.\rEventually, I'd had enough. The aliens can keep the Earth. Its not worth my sanity. I'll go back to \"darkest dungeon\" for my strategy fix. The bad outweighs the good here, which is a huge shame as I loved the original, and there's so many good inclusions to the gameplay and presentation here worth talking about, but I just cant enjoy any of it to care. Its just too hard, and too frustrating.\rFor hardcore xcom players ONLY.",

The amount of polish in this game is breath taking, the MO Cap work and facial animations, stunning. This is keeping the trend of making story in fighting games matter. This one doesn't hit the mark as much for me, I like the new characters, but I felt like they popped up in the story just for the fun of it and didn't have much of a reason outside of just to be there. This happened more than once and I kind of scratched my head (when Hal Jordan shows up its basically out of thin air while you are in the streets...doesn't make a lot of sense.) Focusing on Brainiac as the pivotal plot point isn't as gut wrenching as Super Man going bad and Batman dealing with it, they get to that a bit more and there are some cool moments, but doesn't outshine the first game.\rThe roster adds some nice new additions (Scarecrow and Blue Beetle among my favorite newbies) and all the redesigns seem to be better. The fighting is just as fluid, with some of the supers changing for the better and for worse.\rI think the unlocks became a little too over complicated for my liking, I like my skins and portraits and didn't care for the new loot boxes and equipment drops. On top of that it makes the changing of costumes much more tedious and unlocking items doesn't seem as straight forward.\rFighting AI or a buddy is still lots of fun.\rThe polish...woofta is it good.\rAn enjoyable story, but not as good as the first.\rPadding out the collectibles when they could have added cooler skins=bummer.\rNew roster added some duds in my eyes, but still a good line up of characters.\r8/10",

Stranded on a picturesque island, you must solve puzzles via a deceptively simple interface. It’s true The Witness consist only of maze puzzles -  in the same sense in which languages consist only of words - if you’re willing to learn the words of the language the game slowly teaches you, the satisfaction when you uncover its intricacies can be immense. The puzzles are roughly divided in two types - those whose solution is derived from abstract logical rules and those which require observation of the environment. Sometimes both combine in a very elegant way.\r As for the difficulty - I found that a good strategy was not to give up too easily but also not to try too hard - if you get stuck - change the area - there’s plenty to choose from and you don’t need to solve all the zones to get to the endgame.\r In an interview , the developer said that the theme of the game was epiphany and I think that he has achieved his goal - I doubt it has competition when it comes to the \"Eureka!\" moments, and I'm not talking only about discovering the solution to a particular problem - I'm talking about moments when your whole perspective shifts.\r Some of the flaws I found - I think the game would have benefited from a dedicated story as opposed to the sparse audio logs with an eclectic selection of quotations located randomly around the island. There were some puzzles particularly towards the end that were visually nauseating. These minor flaws do not detract from the singular experience of The Witness - if you have an inkling you might like it - I advise you to try it.",

That in my opinion is a really clever implementation by Jonathan Blow (the genius who made Braid). But don’t let finger puzzles put you off... play this game, the world of The Witness is absolutely breathtaking and there is a good story behind all the puzzles even though it is quite subtle.\rIn my honest opinion this game is better than The Talos Principle and is on par if not better than the original Myst Games.

The least Capcom could have done is put a few extra costumes and stages in there, because otherwise, the only reason to pick this up is if you don’t already have SFV and want a cheap way of buying the game and its first two character packs. SFV will have plenty more years in it, but being so tight and not turning this release into a current ultimate edition is disappointing, even if it’s not surprising.\n                            ",

Capcom have done wonders with the Street Fighter V, especially how their continuous support over he last couple years meant that you always had something to look forward to. With this new update, it brings you all the offline (and online) content you want m, from 6 different arcade ladders, Gallery, Team Battle Mode, Extra Battle and much more. You can get all of that and season 1 + 2 characters for only $40 (£30) which is an amazing deal for those in the fence and are causal players.

In addition to add it, they included a super beefy arcade mode: with 6 paths representing each big chapter in the series and over 200 unlockable images for a new gallery and bonus stages, plus new additions like EX Battle with additional time limited challenges, the team battle versus mode, new UI, gameplay balance, new V-Trigger special move for all players and more.\rThanks to this update that solves the main pending issues, SFV becomes a masterpiece and the best fighting game of the generation.

But with 2 years of refinement under its black belt, plus some seriously impressive additions to its content, this Arcade Edition marks the franchise's highest point since Super Street Fighter II Turbo. The long-requested arcade mode is filled with nostalgic detail, and it gives offline players a compelling reason to keep fighting, something that the original release was sorely lacking.  New V-Triggers will undoubtedly shake up competition online, and while there are still a few classic characters missing from the roster, the selection we have at the beginning of Season 3 is still fantastic on its own merit.  If you've never played Street Fighter V, this is the perfect time to jump in, and if you already own the original, there's absolutely no excuse for not downloading the free update and giving it another chance.  The champ has officially made a comeback, and even in a year packed with high-profile fighting game releases, Street Fighter V Arcade Edition is strong enough to take on any contender that comes its way.",

Although I will say there is a clear lesson to be learned from it: don’t buy Capcom games on release. As a big fan of the series, I purchased the original release. And in its magnanimity, Capcom thanked me for my patronage by updating the incomplete product they sold me free of charge.\rHowever, it doesn’t come with all the features, most notably the seasons 1 & 2 characters. Which means that I would have to spend an amount nearly equivalent to buying the new version in order to have the same game. Oh and Capcom has also slashed the amount of in game currency gained from missions, making it even harder than before to amass enough to unlock all characters. This grind puts Korean MMOs to shame!\rAs for the “well you’ve been playing it for months” argument, I would argue that I have not. The online matchmaking system is not great. And once I was done with story mode, I barely touched the game again.\rSo the lesson here for gamers: if you keep playing ball and buying unfinished products or pay 2 play games that operate on micro transaction models introduced by free 2 play games, or the even worse pay 2 win model, then developers will keep making them. They would be insane not to!\rI really miss the days where there were just 3 options: buy the game, rent the game, or ignore the game.

A lot of games lately have tried to focus on narrative and often end up sacrificing gameplay to do it, while of course there are many games that are fun to play with insipid stories. Somehow Night in the Woods has some of the best dialogue in its wonderful story and is also chock full of all kinds of great gameplay. Here it bucks another trend, often games with multifaceted gameplay tend to focus on quantity over quality, with many things to do that aren't all that terribly well put together. Fortunately all of the different gameplay mechanics in this game are solid and fun. Within the first couple of hours you'll find platforming, dialogue-driven gameplay, dungeon crawling, rhythm gameplay and puzzle solving all placed naturally and with finesse. The characters are unique and well written, and the story also manages to perfectly balance humor and depth. If at all possible it is highly recommended to download and play the two supplementary games on itch.io called \"Lost Constellation\" and \"Longest Night\". They're free, short, well made and give a fantastic introduction to the world and characters. They are not necessary but are fantastic and make parts of the main game more interesting. Also, on a side note, I've been having a blast playing with other people having everyone pick characters and read the dialogue out loud. It sounds silly, but we've been having a blast and laughing out loud constantly. This game is an absolute steal at 20$ and will appeal to all but the most cynical of gamers, and even maybe a few of them. I know it's a cliche line, but you truly owe it to yourself to experience this game. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll smash some cars, play some bass and electrocute yourself.

Like a movie it's best enjoyed by just letting the narrative take you on the journey rather than trying to guess the ending. Im loving it so far though.\r Visuals: cant fault a thing. It doesn't look as good as the order but it is like 10 times bigger than the order in terms of content.

The story combines the best of Peter Parker in and outside his costume. The variety of suits and other unlockables make playing the game until completion more than just worthwhile. In spite of all the convincing reasons to add this game to your PS4 collection, the boss fights feel like a bit of a let-down as the way of defeating them doesn't vary a lot. I would've wished for more BFs in the style of Batman: Arkham City where there is an individual and fun way to defeat every single boss. But who am I kidding: in light of the overall fun I've had playing this I can strongly recommend this to people who like superhero or Spider-Man games in the general.",

The swinging mechanic is so fun and addictive, you can easily just swing around for hours and have a ton of fun. The story, while not perfect, was pretty well constructed and engaging.

Albeit somewhat mproved from the previous gen version of Fifa 14, but the improvement is mostly in the smoothness of the running and the crowd looks a lot more realistic. The main problem though, with Pro Clubs, is every single game you have, against every time, its the same, all any team ever does is play a chipped through ball, every time they get the ball.\rIt's curious reading the critics' reviews and how they are calling it more realistic than ever, as I can not say I often see chipped through balls in football often at all, let alone every single time a team gets the ball. The entirety of Pro Clubs is based on holding the X or Jockey button when you're not on the ball, and then when you get the ball, hitting chipped through ball to a runner on the counter. It's so repetitive it is quite incredible.\rHead to heads are ok, but I wouldn't say they were an improvement on Fifa 13.\rBut the worst thing about Fifa 14 is Ultimate team. Ultimate team has been for the last couple of years my favourite part of the game, trading players, saving coins, building your team. EA have made a catastrophe and removed Formation cards, which has in turn flooded the market. Where on the last few years you could sell certain types of players for 1k or 2k a piece, they are now practically worthless, and earning coins has become so much harder to the point where I can not bring myself to play this version of the game. What a disappointment.\rThe game is better than Fifa 14 on the 360 or ps3, so I will score it accordingly, but overall, still an overhyped, over rated, and mostly poor game.",

                "review": "FIFA 14 changes the way the game plays, it's a bit slower and arguably more realistic, but my oh my - it's like being put through an emotional roller-coaster just to get any sense of delight out of the game.\r The game looks good, sounds good but plays - awful. I'm a veteran FIFA player.. and I have never been so frustrated at a game. The problem is is that at Professional difficulty the game is a breeze, too easy, but the next level up, World Class - makes you want to throw your controller at a wall and beat into the wall with pure anger. Usually when I'm having trouble with a game, I adapt and learn how the game plays, so in turn I get better at playing. But FIFA does everything in it's power to screw you over - you are literally being cheated by changing that difficulty setting, and it just isn't right, at all. Let me explain - your players go from brilliant passing, movement and dribbling ability to a team of wandering retards. I mean it. Players feel as flimsy as pieces of paper due to the overpowering and unrealistic strength and pressing of the opposition (I don't care what anybody says, scripting and momentum exist, and in FIFA 14 it's as obvious as ever), you can't get near the opposing players or else you will loose the ball - which makes wing play almost impossible. Furthermore, you know Walcott? Yeah he's a pretty fast dude, but not when it comes to FIFA and can't out pace Terry after getting in behind the defensive line. Countless times I've been in behind the defence baring down on goal - just to be tackled by a CB who all of a sudden had some new found pace. I think you're getting the picture. They're overpowered in every single way. Passing, dribbling, keeping possession, defending, goalkeeping - everything is overpowered to the point where a draw feels like a win, and a clean sheet? Feels more like a cup final victory. The AI is ridiculously overpowered, I do not know what EA was thinking, they said the game was 'challenging yet fun' - they couldn't be any more delusional. On higher difficulty settings - this game is appalling to stick to for longer periods of time, it's not fun, even when I win. The problem isn't that I loose, It's that there's much bullsh*t in the game that leads to goals (players running away from the ball, goalkeepers being retarded, misplaced passes of ridiculous proportions and so on) - it zaps any fun I had playing this game straight out.\r Those are my only issue with this game in terms of game-play. Those of you who play primarily online UT, probably won't run into these problems as much, but for those of you who are looking forward to a 'challenging yet fun' and realistic offline experience, forget about it.\r Away from game-play - it's no major overhaul from FIFA 13. It's basically the previous game with a few small additions thrown in to try and get people excited. Same modes, same UT experience bar a few new features - none of which warrant the full price tag. It's a poor poor effort from EA - they're lucky that PES is as bad a game as it is. I get the feeling I only play FIFA because there is no other game better rather than because FIFA itself is a good game. It really isn't. There has been little innovation since FIFA 12 and I don't expect things to change. The next-gen versions do improve on certain aspects, most notably load times, and lag within menus. Visually the game looks impressive on PS4/XBO - but it's not mind-blowing - although I would recommend to upgrade to the next gen versions.\r Overall, I'm disappointed. But what I'm disappointed in in FIFA 14 has been around for a couple of years now, I guess I was looking forward to the game-play being improved, and I'm sorry but in my eyes, it's taken several steps back. I wish EA would stop giving us the same piece of crap, and actually do something to give the loyal fan base who love FIFA, the game we all want. It's gotten to a point where, when someone asks what's wrong with it, the number one response is 'it's just FIFA'. FIFA is quickly becoming synonymous with crap - but I doubt EA will ever change that so long as they get their money.",

The characters too each have their own unique side stories to them as well\r Look I'm probably not giving this game justice but all I want to say is if you want a REALLY good VN, this is a must buy for the reasons stated above; You wont regret it :D\r Get the third game if you liked these two! Hopefully there might be a bundle sale for all three in the future?",

Its worth noting as well the story is also particularly good and with multiple endings working out who is the real killer can be leave you on a knife edge\r The game also has a story tree which you can reference, and you will begin to see multiple playthroughs will be required, this could be a chore but given each playthrough would need you to make different choices and often play different puzzles, repetition is kept at bay.\r The puzzles themselves can be a bit tough and slightly un-logical, but game has a gentle way of giving you hints so getting truly stuck on a puzzle that will make you want to bin the game is not really likely happen, oh btw a little hint, learn what a digital route is!\r On the whole its really hard not to recommend this, its a sharp port ( Nintendo DS original ) with nice  added features and a decent soundtrack, and from the small part i have already played at the time of writing of the 2nd one, its without a doubt this game is going to leave me with a desire of wanting more.\r Brilliant!!!",

Every now and then there seemed to be a choice to be made, but it wasn't clear to me what I was trying to achieve by those choices. And then all of a sudden the game ended, badly. Whut?\r So it seems that the choices were meaningful, and had I understood the consequences of them, I might have done better. However every other thing I had to do had been explained in such excruciating detail that I figured that these choices were of no great consequence.\r Now, I could go back and make different choices and achieve a different ending. But that would involve a whole lot more tapping X to get through the really boring stuff I've already seen. Sure, I could do some different puzzles, but the puzzles really weren't very good. So I have no motivation to return to this game. In fact I think I'll avoid anime games altogether, I am not seeing the value in them at all.",

All I was really hoping for was some good Nazi shooting sections and hopefully a comparable story to the first, and what I got was delivered tenfold.\r I've had several laugh out loud moments at the over the top story elements and even on the mid-range difficulty find myself being tested by the surprisingly adept AI. The AI is actually the one thing that has been continuously surprising me as I keep finding myself dying to enemies that have managed to sneak up behind me or have remained in cover long enough to jump out at me when I wasn't expecting them to be there. There is one section in a court (without giving anything away) that challenged me in a tooth-clenching, infuriating way that I haven't experienced since gaming as a kid. I knew I could lower the difficulty to breeze through it but I absolutely couldn't, it felt wrong to do so.\r All around this has been way more than I was expecting and I already had very high hopes. I've been burned recently with pre-orders (Mass Effect Andromeda) and vowed never to buy a game that way again.

The story still feautures Nazi's that somehow all have the personality of the Jesse Eisenberg character in Batman vs. Superman. The inclusion of some really Ridiculous super technology alienates the story and setting from any historic truth, and the Nazi’s who were known for their swift technological advances, brutality, hate and deadly precision have become dumb psychopaths who do stuff to kill their own boredom.\r Already a thing in the first Wolfenstein, this game also has some strange shooting mechanics, mainly the way guns behave. During development, the question should always arise: 'Does this make the game better, more enjoyable?' Clearly this wasn't done for Wolfenstein 2, as guns have an undying attraction to the ceilling. Guns have horrible accuracy and barely hit targets unless you embrace a wrestling match with your weapon. Dual wielding becomes a baby sitting job instead of it being a goofy feauture to have fun.\r I was frustrated with the game within 2 hours, and felt a wave of relieve once i traded it in. I give this game a 6/10, which means it is an average game. However, this is a personal opinion obviously.

The faults in question were never game breaking or frustrating but rather just tiny little nitpicks here and there that just stopped it from being a near perfect masterpiece. This remastering, however, has fixed any issue the original had and turns Odin Sphere into a game that can sit along side the greatest games ever made.\rThe combat is as fluid and solid as action based combat can get with minor improvements taking cues from Vanillaware's later title 'Muramasa: The Demon Blade' and the more recent Indie game 'Guacamelee' from Drinkbox Studio. The crafting and upgrading systems have been tweaked to be more modern and coherent. The ground breaking graphics and animation have had a crisp make-over and the stunning music and well acted voice work has been cleaned up.\rThis is exactly what a remaster should be; take a classic game and modernize it and make it more accessible without compromising it's original integrity.\rWhat else can I say? If you liked the original; this is a better version (and for purists, there is 'classic mode' where the original game play is in tact). For fans of more recent Vanillaware titles like Muramasa: Rebirth and Dragon's Crown; Odin Sphere, in my opinion, is the definitive Vanillaware title. Hell, anyone into action JRPG's in general will find plenty to love in this game.\rIt was an absolutely wonderful experience on the PS2 and it's just gotten better. 10/10",

The hand-drawn characters and backgrounds (though animated with splines and modern methods) are absolutely gorgeous.\r The gameplay is smooth and fun, even if most of the special abilities aren’t all that useful, so you end up using a handful only. The music, while not the kind of thing I’d listen to outside the game (like I do with Nier: Automata), was very well done.\r The characters are interesting and well-developed, though my favorites were Mercedes (the fairy), and Velvet (the unfortunately oversexualized fire mage).\r The replayability is okay because of the structure of the game and the New Game+ mode, but the game is a bit repetitive in general, so it's probably not something you want to immediately restart upon finishing, like maybe some of the Tales or Disgaea games are.\r The difficulty is another weird one. It’s whatever you want it to be, from easy to impossible. Like Nier: Automata, however, there’s a huge jump from Normal to Hard. There’s also a Heroic mode where one hit kills you - that’s pretty insane, but if you want a challenge, go for it.\r My one complaint is that several women in the story are oversexualized. Only the playable character Velvet is, but every single female fairy or female efreet is your typical barbie doll with huge boobs popping out of their clothing.\r Overall, a highly recommended game. It’s not super long - I beat it in about 45 hours total, but with replayability involved, it’s longer. Even just at that length, it’s still worth it. If you like the 2D old-school Tales games, definitely in particular give this one a shot.",

Well I had to wait for an expansion but yeah I'm just happy to have it. The Souls series is by far my favorite game series of all time. Yes, even surpassing my favorites Fallout and Witcher. I was a bigger fan of Demon Souls and Dark Souls, looking past the framerate issues Dark Souls was still a gem of perfection in the action adventure genre. No game ever came close to that sense of fear, exploration, reward and challenge the Soul series provided. Not since Devil May Cry 3 have I taken a game seriously.\r I find myself going to DkS2 wikis and inputting my character builds I make, interacting with the fanbase to discuss PvP strategies and even creating walkthroughs. Because it's simply fun, I enjoy making builds and debating on strategies, because this game warrants that kind of attention. It's like Dungeon and Dragon level of dedication and character classes. You make characters and face REAL danger. If you don't pay attention to what you're leveling up, you can easily ruin an entire playthough and be stuck with a bad character. But when you get that character right, and you put your knowledge behind it you can accomplish things that will actually make other players envy you. This game rewards you for taking it seriously and actually putting in work to become better.\r You will not reach the higher ranks of the Brotherhood of Blood covenant through some exploits or cheats. You must defeat 500 players, if you lose in a duel it will remove a point. That is some serious dedication, but you will be rewarded with a special character color when summoned as well as a powerful fire spell. The bright red glow of your character tells others you've accomplished one of the game's most difficult task. Defeating bosses and beating the game while in the Company of Champions covenant is hard, but other players will prove to be your most challenging foe. And to say you've reached 500 kills in PvP is a bragging right not many people will have.\r It blends single player and multiplayer like no other game before it. You could be breezing through an area only to be invaded by another player, or having a seriously difficult time getting through an area and summon a helpful co-op ally to aid you. Should you both kill a boss and accomplish your goal you'll both be rewarded.\r Immersion in Dark Souls 2 is second to nothing. This game will really make you feel like you're the one in danger. You'll be traveling down a dark hallway, low on health and supplies, too far away from your last bonfire to give up and you've never been to this location before. Your touch makes an outline of a shadow up ahead and you stop dead in tracks to observe. A normal foe? Or your next death? Getting to close will trigger a fight you might not be prepared for, but you inch forward trying to make out the enemy that lays beyond the glow of your torch. You have two choices; sneak up and attack the enemy as quick as possible, or head back to reclaim your health. Both choices have their consequences for the enemy may claim your life, but the bonfire will respawn the enemies before it. This is where the game truly shines.\r Combat is beyond anything I've ever seen. Two hand a weapon, one hand weapon one hand shield, bows, staffs, flame casting, whips, swords, greatswords, axes, hammers, claws, fist weapons, spears, halbreds, katanas, twinblades, curved blades, dual wielding weapons, chimes and daggers. So many different types of weapons, so many weapon choices for each category. And you choice what you'll wield. You make your character to use what's best for you. My Ninja Sorcerer Assassin couldn't be anymore awesome if I tried. Katana duel wielding a staff... that's just the surface ,too. The combat requires practice. Strategy and thought will be your great tools. No one button combos, you have a multitude of attacks to use. Rolling weak attack, back dash attack, running attack, parry attack, backstabs, strong attacks and jump attacks. You must study an enemy's attacks before fighting them, running into battle with no knowledge of your enemy and wildly swinging attacks will get you killed. In PvP you must size up the player and see if they have a pattern to their strategies you can use to get in for a hit.\r Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin fixes a lot of issues in the first edition. This allows players to focus much more on the game, rather than stare at their Soul Memory forever worried of going over their level up. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an action adventure RPG we've been waiting for. It's an homage to classic retro games and their brutal difficulty. It's an immersive experience. It's... DARK SOULS BABY! Get in there!\r (Oh right uhm, there's new stuff in SotFS. Torches are actually more important now to see. SM was changed. They've added in new monsters in areas. They've made the game look and run better!)",

It was not intended to be apart of the game... weapons are suppose to break but not after 10 swings with any weapon... Im sorry but I find this remake to be in poor taste and not worth any sum of money past 5 dollars the original for ps3 holds for value as it stands as a complete unbroken game with real challenges. If your a masochist though go play scholars of first sin it will not disappoint you in the department of difficulty.. I love hard games but only if they are unbroken and meant to be hard I dont like hard games with game breaking glitches that go in favor of bosses and npc giving them more of  a upperhand and you a handicap. Until this weapon durability glitch is fixed I cannot give this game more than a zero.. even with no bugs id give this game a 6-7 out of 10 because of it being copy and pasted to next gen and sold for the price of a new game.. all con artists ....",

In the strategy guide there's roughly 150 quests and I estimate the map is about as big as skyrim's, but there seems to be a higher density of areas to explore with fewer mountains and whatnot in the way to make the map feel bigger than it actually is.\r In comparison to previous Fallouts people keep saying it isn't a big step up. I disagree with them, but I will admit the facial expression are a bit stiff and lip syncing is a tiny bit off. Some people dislike the aesthetics of the game because they went with a much more punchy and bright color pallet rather than just make everything poop brown and puke green like Fallout 3. I actually enjoyed the more colorful environments.\r Looking at the pc specs this game is technically graphically superior to any other game out right now even if some people are saying the graphics are not very good. I honestly thought the graphics looked amazing, but I'm just putting it out there that not everybody shares my opinion and some people think games like Witcher 3 actually have better graphics. Personally, I don't think it should matter all that much because it's really about gameplay, not graphics.\r Gameplay wise what Fallout 4 brings to the table over previous games is a vastly improved combat system, much better balance regarding things like stimpacks and perks, and overall more challenge on higher difficulties. Gun play feels almost exactly like Call of Duty instead of very stiff and clunky like New Vegas. You definitely will feel noticeable improvements on how guns and things handle regarding sight clarity, draw animations, sway, recoil, and smoothness adjusting aim. Movement also feels more in line with Call of Duty. Sprint is in the game and is balanced by taking away action points to use in vats, a great mechanic imo that adds more fluidity and better pacing to everything. In other words you no longer have to worry about slowly plodding from one area to the next making for less overall downtime to deal with.\r What this game offers over Destiny, which probably it's main competition atm is a much more engaging story and much much more content than Destiny could ever hope to deliver. I mean in comparison I finished Destiny including all story missions, all strikes, and the two raids in about 20 hours. The story missions in the vanilla game itself you could easily get through in about 5 hours. Even if all 150 quests take a half hour each you are still talking about 75 hours of content to go through so even the most viscous haters on here would have to admit at minimum this game at least offers a lot in quantity of content even if one could make an argument about the quality of it.\r Sound wise Fallout 4 offers MUCH more voice actors than previous games leading to much more variations in how npcs interact. Games like Elder Scrolls online will recycle the same voice actors. It's not like that in this game. I also enjoyed how gun sounds have much more \"oomph\" than Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Everything sounded like it really had impact and the blood splatter in response seemed really satisfying. Unfortunately, didn't like the music track in the game so far, but oh well.\r People on here are complaining about very specific nitpicky issues with the game like for instance the facial expression/lip syncing issue, a few specific non game breaking bugs, color aestetics, and blah, blah, blah.\r All I got to say is please examine the facts for yourself. I encourage anybody reading this to just look at the amount of content and all the customization and what you are getting here and then decide based on that rather than some extremely specific little thing somebody is complaining about.\r I assure you this game has a lot of bang to offer for your 60 bucks and well deserves 10/10 in my very honest opinion.",

My second was with The Last Of Us which is now one of my favorite games of all time.\r I just finished Uncharted 1-3 and I'm surprised to have a love-hate relationship with them. The things they do well, they do SO well. The large action set-pieces, the details everywhere, the grand scale of the adventures you go on, and even the voice acting and excellent facial animations. Sometimes the acting is a little hokey, but i think that is intentional.\r Then there were things that bothered me equally as much. The joke of a cover system and all the frustrating deaths they caused may have been the biggest. I believe they nailed the cover system with TLOU, and hope they never go back. The cheap setups for deaths was also incredibly frustrating. it's not good writing, or gaming for that matter, to walk out onto a bridge and be one-shot-killed by an RPG. There's numerous spots where you just have to know what's going to happen or do something very specifically, or you die. There were also small things too like fluctuating enemy health, grenade throwback not working, etc.\r Overall, I believe I have a much more unbiased view than many people here. I'm not looking back on these games with rose colored glasses. There are issues with them, and they are NOT perfect games by any means. Ignore the 10/10 reviews .. but equally, ignore the 1/10 reviews as well! Both are very wrong. These games fall somewhere in the middle... however, the love that Naughty Dog puts into their games is VERY evident. These are REALLY good games that are GREAT at times. The opening of Uncharted 2 & 3 are, in my opinion, perfect. It's just too bad the quality seems to falter in certain areas that REALLY hurt the overall score.\rUncharted 1 - 7/10\rUncharted 2 - 8/10\rUncharted 3 - 8.5/10\r Overall - 7.9",

The voice acting is fantastic, the story is very engaging, and, most importantly, it is a great companion to the Borderlands series. If you haven't played a game in the series before, this is a great introduction to it. It shows what the series is like, and just how interesting the world is. It also does this with very little gameplay. Hopefully the Borderlands movie is as good as this...",

First if you're familiar with the Borderlands franchise you may wonder how an open-world game based on loot and co-op will be when very story focused. Well it was awesome, the guys from Telltale truly respected the work made by Gearbox with many references and characters from the previous games and a main story that follow the events of Borderlands 2 providing new awesome characters (I hope some of them will be in an expected Borderlands 3), they also keep the same graphic art than the original games, which makes Tales From The Borderlands the best looking Telltale game by far.\r The five episodes are full of hilarious jokes, epic and moving moments, the wait between each episode was very long thanks to nice cliffhangers, it really was an intense experience, you'll never be bored playing this game. My only complaint is that (like most Telltale games) choices have only minor repercussions, all the big events stay the same, but hey at least there is some changes.\r Finally the length of the game is pretty reasonable, approximately 12 hours for 20€/$ it's cheaper than 5 movies in a theater (in France at least) or many videogames sold 70 €/$ and sometimes shorter. Tales From The Borderlands is the best game Telltale made since the season 1 of Walking Dead and is a shiny example of how great an interactive story can be.",

Fuel management during the practice sessions and the classic F1 cars are great additions to the series, although I would like to have seen a Benneton F1 car included. The game runs at a very smooth 60fps which is a must when it comes to racing games for me.

The AI is the same we've seen since ToCa Race Driver as the drivers don't race for their own success, but to prevent the player from being successful by any means necessary - usually this means running at the player not unlike a freight train, or in case of the player not being near enough for that, driving in an inhumanely perfect fashion 100% of the time. On the flipside in regards to fast racing, when driving slow behind the safety car for example, the drivers ahead of you may slow down so much that you end up becoming a ghost (a terrible feature that you can't disable) while they don't and at least one driver behind you gets a legal overtake as a result.\r And when it comes to AI ramming you, after the AI pushes you into the barriers and ends your race, the other teams' interest in you diminishes by a ridiculous amount as if you're the one to actually blame for even trying to be on the track. Every. Single. Time. And this often breaks the whole contract system apart unless you somehow manage to be lucky enough to upgrade your car to beat better teams - which would normally happen around season 3 at the earliest.\r The weather system is also one of the worst I've seen in an F1-game: there are four different stable percentages (let's assuming it's 0%, 33%, 67% and 100%, condition wise it's \"dry,\" \"light rain,\" \"heavy rain,\" and \"HR w/ standing water\") that are always the same if the weather doesn't transition to anything else. The track is evel less dynamic as it's the same amount of wetness in all parts, of course depending on the overall conditions - actually, it's technically not at all dynamic, even if Codemasters have falsely advertized (illegal, by the way) it as such since 2010. Plus the physics are terrible, most evidently in case of car-to-car contact.\r If you want good examples of F1-games in simcade or sim-categories, pretty much anything you saw as a Sony-exclusive and Crammond's Grand Prix series was more advanced and realistic than this amateurish construct that makes the sport look bad in the eyes of a person who knows even the tiniest bit about the workings of racing.",

It's a functionally great game with a unique concept that you don't see as often nowadays, and really does have a good game mechanically.\r But this game is just so boring...\r So, I'm a kid who was raised on space shooters like Galaga and Bosconian, so this review may have a bit of bias in it. But all this game does is have you collect \"survivors\" by flying up to them. That's the point of the game. And for about the first 6 or 7 levels I was telling myself \"Okay, this is all tutorial stuff, I'm sure the actual game will heat up soon enough!\" So I kept playing on. But nope. Collecting this games equivalent to coins.\r And it's too easy! Once you get the mechanics figured out, it's not a hard game. Half the time I would buzz through the level with Silver, 3 stripes, and 3 stars.\rAt one point I just got bored of the levels I was in, and thanks to all the XP I got I could jump 10 levels ahead (which, by the way the game requires you to earn a certain XP before going to other levels, but since the game's too easy I got so much XP playing a couple levels I could usually jump more levels up). And you know what? It was still boring!\r BUT WAIT! There's a section where you play as a human and run around! This time, you'll be collecting crystals!\rAren't you just so lucky????\r And all that does is break up the bits of gameplay that are actually good. It feels like two completely different game-sets, where either one could've done fine on its own without the other. But going from moving in all directions to a Metroid-vania style just feels weird, and later down the line they decide it's a good idea to put multiple breaks in the flying to have these sections.\r And finally, the one hit kills in this game are bad. In a game like Galaga or Space Invaders, the developers can get away with one hit kills because you know what you're up against and you can see what's shooting you.\rBut this game can't get away with that.\rSee, because enemies are such a scarcity, sometimes you'll just be rushing through the level and all of the sudden you'll just die. Enemy placement is very cheap, purposefully trying to be out of sight or just barely out of the shot until you move a little to the left and get blown up.\rI felt robbed on those occasions because there's no way of knowing when those come, and unlike something like Castlevania where you're always on your toes, this game you let your guard down because you might spend whole levels not even being shot at once.\rOr, the few enemies you do get to fight are turrets stuck in one place, and they just shoot at you. But their bullets are one hit KO's. So the game designers set 2 near a wall and spam you with bombs!\r This is a game that wants you to go fast but punishes you for doing so. It puts me on a timer but forces me multiple times to go backwards in the level because of portals (yeah, the game uses portals and forces you to backtrack throughout certain areas up to 3 times!). It gives you all this freedom of movement and shooting but forces you to switch into Running mode.\r Again, the game works, but I find it to be a very boring experience. Even though it's free for PS Plus, I find it to be a very dull experience nonetheless. I still prefer the older games to this. You should still download this for free if you have PS Plus to see if you like it, but it's not something I liked.",

In almost any way and aspect.\rIts charming, chilled, rewarding, deep, mysterious, just plain and simple fun, no matter how you Play it or what you do to spend your ingame time, harvesting, mining, fishing, exploring, all makes sense, gets you Progress and gets you more and more attached to your farm, the game world and his inhabitants.\rThe graphics are extremely good, so is the Soundtrack. And aside from some small control issues (that could be fixed) theres hardly any Point to criticise about this game.\rThe lack of German Texts is by far the biggest fault the game has so far (im from Europe and the game is just in english which is a shame for the not english speaking or younger audience) - although the PC Version got patched so theres hope for a console languaga patch as well.\rSmall control issues aside the only real drag is the Overall lack of Information you get as a Player but this is very well part of the Experience.\rStardew Valley wants to be explored, tried out and experienced on your own. And although some may think that the start (almost the two first years) is very dragging since Progress is so slow, its exactly this that makes you grow so attached to what you built up in the game - the Progress you make really feels like its earned. And no matter what you do in the game, theres no \"wrong\" or \"false decision\" to make, or even a \"false way to Play\" ... StardewValley always rewards you for everything and anything.\rStardew Valley creates not only a warm and just good Feeling while playing, its simply put a one of a Kind experience, a true successor of all that made Harvest Moon such a classic, also evolving and expanding on it in just the right ways.\rIts one of the best Indie Games ever made, and one that you can Play for hours on end or just a few minutes in between.

Since \"Sign\" left off with a huge cliffhanger Story wise (and much to be desired when it Comes to the character roster) - Revelator packs up as a full fledged Sequel, continuing the Story, adding a few chars and tweaking/improving the Systems even further.\rIn short, the new chars are Overall pretty great, though I admit ist a huge letdown that two of them have to be bought with real cash (they were free to download for a while). And as much as Johnny, Jam and Dizzy are welcomed yet again to the roster, the new chars like Jack-O, Kum and Raven also add to the huge variety of the GG chars and fit in very well in both design and fighting style.\rStill a shame that so many of the past chars are still absent (just to save em up for future installments).\rThe Story mode is - yet again - a sorta 3 hrs Long Anime movie that catches up where \"Sign\" left off and Ends with .. you know it ... a huge cliffhanger as soon as things start to get really interesting.\rThe Online Mode has been vastly improved in ist awkward design, with Lobbys and Avatars to meet up, Chat, and of  course  compete.\rTheres hardly any lag noticeable as far as I have experieced, but - GG is not so populated online as Id wish.\rFinding a ranked match can take forever if you are lookin in another Region than US or JP.\rFor single Players theres also plenty to do - a very good Tutorial, Combo Training and Challenge Mode teach you all there is to know about the complex fighting mechanics, the Arcade and VS Modes are kinda self explainatory, with the Survival Mode \"MOM\" being the star of the Show here (where you collect medals, can buy Upgrades for your character and dive deeper an deeper). Theres also a Gallery mode where you can spend the ingame earned Money for new Character Colors, Artworks and Stuff like that.\rThe graphics and the Soundtrack have to be mentioned especially, since its even imporoved over the predecessor - eveything Looks sharper.\rThe only real negative about this game is the lack of so many characters that I grew attached to as a Long term fan, that two chars from the roster have to be bought with real Money as a highly overpriced DLC, and that the Story leaves you with a cliffhanger like someone cuts off the energy in the middle of a tense fight.\rDont worry though - Revelator2 is announced already, so in a few months (spring 2017) it will all continue.\rIts also a shame that there is no english voiceover - I get extremely annoyed by japanese voices (I know thats weird coming from an Anime Fan) but thats not as much of a big deal as the missing characters (Justice, Testament, Kliff, Bridget - what the hell ArcSys lol).\rAlso kinda sad that there will be almost as many updates to \"Xrd\" as there have been with \"X\" before.\rMilk that cow ArcSys.\rApart from that - probably the best fighting game of this gen so far.\rMust buy for anyone that has interest in fighting games.",

The story line is superb, character development was excellent and it really had a modern feel to it regarding the battle system and movement. The remaster has really put a huge difference into the game-play, from now being able to control guest party members, to the separation of the MP bar and Mist gauge so that MP is not drained from use of Quickenings. The only issue that I would have with this game is the new license board system, it is a bit of a drag but I suppose it also allows for players to give characters a certain individuality that plays into your own hands, so I am more so on the fence than anything else. But above all this game would be one of my favorites, especially with the remaster. I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",

                "review": "Excelent remaster of an excelent game.\r I'll go straight into the changes introduced to this version:\r For those experienced with the original release, a few things to know: this version introduces the Zodiac Job System, which greatly encourages the use of all of your party members: the first time using the license board, players are tasked to give the party member 1 out of 12 zodiac signs, each one assigned to one job (or class, if you prefer). Por example: Aries are White Mages, and the licence board is balanced for that kind of class, therefore, no zodiac has all of the habilities in the game, unlike the original release, where the licence board was the same for every character, thus rendering all of the party embers the same. It might sound intimidating at first, but with propper thought and strategy, it gives each character an specific role, so it's a welcome adition. Do not fret, for you can chose in the early game a second zodiac (job[class]) for your characters, so you might aswell counter-balance the effects, for example making a character \"Tauro-Capricorn\" (lancer-black mage) or Leo-Aries (knight-white mage), the choice is yours: counter-balance their class, or enhance it even further.\r The game seems to be balanced for this change, though, as i felt the enemies and bosses where easier this time arround (but not a walk in the park, mind you, just balanced for the adjustments on the class system). Also, no longer is the Zodiak spear unattainable should you open one of those \"forbidden\" treasure chests of the original release, for there is one more way to get it (besides the Henne mines method), altough is also hard, but 100% safe.\r It helps a lot Square decided to make of the \"L1\" button a fast-forward button, speeding the game up to 4x, with this, farming and traveling is much (much!) less frustrating and repetitive, and should be a welcome change for \"completisionists\" out there.\r In the end, i felt this remaster to be the best i've played in years, and makes an awesome game even better. Final Fantasy XII deserves a second chance, for is it one of the best in the series, content and gameplay wise. Even then, on a second playthrough (1st one being back in 2006), this time the story felt way more interesting, either be that i already knew what to expect, or because our expectations betrayed us back in the day, regardless, i so much more enjoyed the characters and story this time arround.",

It simply was way ahead of its time. The more I play, the more baffled I am to how modern and fresh 12 actually is. The story is dark and mature, the cast of characters all have their charm, the gameplay is tight, the gambit system is deep and filled with strategy; the game is just impossible to put down.\r I can't remember, in years, of a game that got me itching to come back home from work and play. I remember spending dozens - if not hundreds - of hours with this game, years ago. And I can't wait do it all over again.\r Of course this is not a perfect game and it will show its age here and there.

It might be the best fight mechanic for an RPG that I’ve ever seen. The gambit system for giving very fine-tuned control over the rules your party follows in battle is really exemplary. I wish other games had that level of control. I’d say that the only bad side of that is that it also left me feeling out of the loop. After you set up your rules, you almost don’t need to touch your controller any more. That being said, you don’t have to turn it on, so it’s entirely up to you how hands-on you want to be with the battles.\r The world setting and visuals were good. They didn’t stand out to me as particularly special, but they were still well crafted and engaging.\r The music was pretty well done. A little above standard fare for quality triple-A games these days, but not quite the top tier like the mind-blowing Nier:Automata soundtrack.\r The plotline was good. Also HUGE. Main plot line took me 70+ hours. I’ve heard people complain about the plot, but it made way more sense than FFIX and FFX to me. In fact, it’s the most realistic and believable FF plot out of all of them, other than FFT. It’s a war chronicle, not so much a monomyth arc. Maybe that throws people for a loop.\r Also, I’ll address this at the same time as characters, because it’s related: Vaan is not the main character. Sure, he’s the one you control, but the main focus is elsewhere. However, no ONE other character is really the “main” either. A whole bunch of people are intertwined in a global set of events. Thus the “war chronicle” mention above. On one hand, this means there’s no great Hero’s Journey and singular focus character. On the other, since when did every story need to be that? Vaan is a stand-in for the narrator. He’s a witness. He isn’t world-changing in himself, he’s just a naive but kind kid that’s tagging along and witnessing history in the making.\r All of the other characters I liked quite a bit. There’s not as much heavy interaction between them as, say, Tales of Berseria. But they’re well done and everyone has their own important arc and place in the patchwork quilt of the plot. No cloyingly grating characters like Quina and Zidane in FFIX.\r Call out for some stupid sexualization fan-service crap. Fran and every Viera are all sexed up all the time. Ashe’s miniskirt can’t possibly be shorter and get a non-Mature rating. Penelo’s bodysuit is fine but we desperately need to see her inner thighs, apparently. And there are a handful of ridiculous barely-clothed characters in the background - geez that lingerie-wearing pirate was over the top.\r There’s a ton of side quests and post-game, though almost all of it is more hunts for monsters. I think FFX had more, but I didn’t platinum either of them, as I got bored of just doing fights over and over. A few of them (like Yiazmat) are literally 4-10 HOUR long battles that are more about babysitting your automated characters than really fighting.\r Another major issue is that most of the skills and magic in the game are not purchased. They’re in random buckets strewn across the countryside. Really. Forgot to open that one chest tucked into the tree in that level 3 plot points ago? Guess you don’t need that spell after all. Good luck going back to find it later, you’ll never purchase it. It hits the later spells harder - Cure isn’t one of them, but many of the basic RPG staples are literally hidden in buckets.\r Also, espers are completely useless. You need to use one for a plot point. I never used one again. You collect all 13 if you want to play Pokemon.\r Also the job system is crap. Just turn it off and play the original license (ability) board instead, where everyone can be everything. Otherwise, you must immediately pick a class for each character when you get them, and you can NEVER change class.\r Replayability is decent, there’s two New Game+ modes - strong and weak. One is you starting at level 90 (no other carry overs) and the other is you stuck at level 1 forever and forced to do a low-level game.\r The Trial mode (100 consecutive battles, completely separate from the game - literally a different selection on the Title Screen) is also interesting - you can get some good XP and goodies there. Don’t forget it to look up how to transfer your goods back to the normal game.\r The difficulty was medium. You can easily run off to a hard area and get creamed, so be careful, though. Also, don’t feel like you need to do every available hunt as soon as it pops up. Wait a few levels or it can get really frustrating.\r Overall good. IMHO the best FF up to this point since FFVII. Good and bad points, but overall a quality game and worth a play.",

I am so delighted and I have a new found respect for Capcom.\r The story is awesome. It's not your \"american horror story texas chainsaw massacre\". In fact, it is actually JUST as Resident Evil 1... it's actually a conspiracy plot.\r You could tell that they did everything they could to study the older Resident Evils and find out what artistic elements made them what they were: Art.  This shows big time from: The way the story progresses, the perfect balance of shooting without going into excess like Evil within did, great atmosphere, files and diaries you read to uncover the plot yourself, the item lockbox, the save rooms, the well-made puzzles, herbs for healing, the environments that were reminiscent of RE(they paid homage to the Main Hall of the Mansion from RE1 by making a similar main entrance), terrifying scenes, etc etc\r The only Con?  The game is too short. I took my time and finished in 8 hours.  But hey... I rather have a short game that is excellent  than a long game that is a crappy attempt at pleasing the action crowd.\r Look.  I am HARD to please. I rarely play video games.

I know this sounds naive; all MMOs are 'endless', I just never grasped this thought in a realistic way.\r Before the expansion, I had pretty much everything capped; from jobs to gathering and crafting classes.

And I just decided that I should use my little time outside work to do something else. Take better care of myself, invest more in my social life and play games, yes, of course, always; but a more reasonable amount.\r Heavensward is 'more of the same' in a bittersweet way for me. I don't know. It's like a lover that you 'love, but don't like anymore'. And, as I say this goodbye, I stick with the thought that my beloved character will carry on, in Eorzea, the rest of my adventures. I just won't be there anymore to see it.

There's not even daily rewards for logging in or anything.\r You never get to use your mailbox unless you pay more money to buy extra stuff, and then there's the new app that is absolutely useless and you also have to pay even more money to use.\r This game is just a huge cash grab, exploiting the FF fanbase while the content is locked inside a cage, not for everyone to enjoy.  Like i said i dont mind subbing a month if there was more motivation to play like more rewards unlocked instantly. Just not enough to keep me as a subscriber.\r Also super complex to get into, i cant for the life of me recommend this game to friends and those that have played it for free, instantly fell of that train due to how insanely complex it is to start, make your own menus and go start the fetch postman quests.\r Sorry that this review is overly negative, it could be the best game ever like Nintendo and EA for example, they take the same greedy route.\r Heavensward is definetly alot better expansion and makes the gameplay more fun IF you either paid to skip, bought also extra expansions with the game itself and the monthly sub lol or actually like me, played through the horrendous ARR content which i regret because i burnt out playing afterwards.\r I wanna recommend this game and give it a thumbs up and maybe in the future i can :)",

                "review": "Last year the best JRPG on the PS4 was Persona 5, and this year is Dragon Quest XI! Persona 5 was a great success for Atlus because it kept its unique style - they used the same formula which they used in the predecessors. The same thing Square Enix has done with Dragon Quest XI. The story of this game is great, but I will not talk about the story because of spoilers. I will actually say something about gameplay. Dragon Quest XI is a turn-based RPG with a semi-open world. The semi-open world allows to player to explore the world through the story, so that you can explore a new region then you must first advance through the story. This way the player can enjoy the story and a gameplay at the same time (it's not like open world games where you can completely ignore the story and use only the mechanics of gameplay). There is no more random encounter. Now, the enemies are moving freely on the map and if the player make a contact with the enemies, the battle screen will open. The battle system is the same as the predecessor with a couple of new elements. Now, the player can choose between two styles in battle: classic style (characters are stationary on battlefield) and modern style (characters can be moved around battlefield). One of new element is a swapping system which allows players to change characters during battle with those who are outside the active team (this reminds me of battle system from FFX). This function can allow you to make a better strategy (tactic) in battle. When comparing gameplay of Dragon Quest XI with Dragon Quest VIII (the best Dragon Quest game), I can say that Dragon Quest XI is an upgraded version of Dragon Quest VIII (so for this reason would like to see the remake of Dragon Quest VIII for the PS4 with the same engine). Full 14 years, Dragon Quest VIII has kept the title of the best Dragon Quest game, and now it has been surpassed by Dragon Quest XI. As a conclusion I can say that Dragon Quest XI has a great story, gameplay, very beautiful graphics and great sound. This game is the best Dragon Quest game and is one of the best JRPGs ever. We need more such JRPGs on PlayStation, with turn-based battle system and semi-open world. Persona 5 and Dragon Quest XI prove that such games can be more successful than some action RPGs.",

Not DQXI. This ability to keep me interested, to keep me moving forward is what makes this one so special.\rThe turn based battle system is full of strategy. Rarely can you coast on simple “attack attack attack” motions go get through an area. Thinking ahead, and learning the flow of each areas battles is essential and extremely satisfying once you’ve got it figured out.\rSo we’ve got a great, easy to follow story, and great combat.  The characters are all great and have their own personalities. Nothing seems tacked on.\rMy only complaint is the crafting system. It’s too difficult to find recipes, and many of the items required are so rare that I never want to use them incase a find a better recipe down the road. To get around that I’ve just been level grinding so I can afford to buy most weapons and armour from the store. You can be a rare item hunter or a grinder. The choice is yours, but a strategy involving both techniques is recommended.\rI really could write so much more, but I think you get the idea. You probably already understand this is a turn based classic style RPG. And I’m just here to tell you all the elements that make that genre of game special are all here, and accounted for. And don’t worry the game will always give you hints on your next stop, rarely being vague in the process.

I dont even like mmo and grind games, but this somehow is addicting i cant stop playing it. Hell, this year i even like it more than Witcher 3 or MGS5. Totally Game of the year for me.\rI can understand anger of gamers who bought vanilla for 60$ and now have to pay again 40$ for expansion, but for me as a new player it was fantastic deal.\rThe only flaw i can see in this game is that not all activities have matchmaking, and because i dont have friends who have PS4 and play Destiny i cant do raids or arenas. And world could be bigger, after a while you just grind in places you know.\rBut besides that- perfect game, shooting mechanics, the loot, beautiful graphics, everything is awesome here. Play it if you havent already.",

The taken king meets its core player half way with an actual story, great new gear and weapons,  rewarding those who grind away, and much needed balance to the weapons system. As much as i love the new much awaited dlc, its not exactly perfect. Some areas are reused and for the price tag of 40 dollars i would like to expect completely new areas, if you plan correctly you can reach its new level cap in a matter of minutes which kinda defeats the purpose of the gameplay imo, and you cant help but feel that this should have have been the complete from day one.\r PROS:\rfun\rWorth the buy if dedicated fan\rgreat weapon and amor system\rgrinding is more rewarding\rmeeting demands to current fanbase\rVisuals are awesome\rabout an additional 7-10 hours of additional gameplay\ra more balanced game\r CONS:\ryear 1 exotics nerf\rprice of dlc of important content that should have been added since day one\rreuse of same areas\rprice of dlc for year one players total $160 spent with tax\r Overall a great buy and fun game.",

                "review": "So far, not at all worth the $40 price. Trying to keep this objective: The game with the Taken King \"expansion\" does not live up to the expectations.\r- Depending on the player, the new story missions and Strikes can be very quick to complete. If you are a new player, you can start with the original story and the stories from the Dark Below and House of Wolves dlcs, which will add to the play time, but it is still a short campaign with a mediocre, unengaging story. If you are a fan of games with a long and/or interesting storyline, I would recommend skipping Destiny altogether.\r- Bungie hyped strike-exclusive armor in their Twitch live stream: Only 3 pieces of armor per class across all Strikes. Similarly, preorder bonuses for the game were weak, \"Uncommon\" tier weapons, which is disappointing.\r- More content/activities have been taken away from the game than was added; this is not an expansion of the game. If you are buying the Collectors edition, or any other edition which bundles TTK with the base game, TDB and HOW dlcs, you are not receiving your money's worth, because all content previous to TTK is irrelevant now. Similarly, if you are a PVP player, be forewarned that without the Taken King, your options for PVP game modes has been severely reduced from what existed only a few weeks ago. On another note, the PVP activities are poorly balanced, with some weapon types and character classes being vastly superior to the others. Bungie has done nearly nothing to alleviate these problems.\r- Poor communication: across all sources, Bungie has failed to adequately communicate with the players and community, often providing misleading teaser information that ends up being a negative change. This has been a problem since the beginning, and will continue for the forseeable future.\r- You will need to be very careful about how you order the DLCs: With the Taken King dlc, you will not be able to play it on another account on same PlayStation, XBox, etc., and all previous DLCs _must_ be downloaded by the same PSN ID/Xbox ID as Taken King. Numerous people have been reporting issues with this, without any response from Bungie.\r- Nolan North: minor annoyance, but the new voice actor for the Ghost (a little companion which tells the \"story\" of Destiny) is incredibly annoying.\r Thanks for reading :)\r~ Atomkinder",

The characters are all pretty unique with great designs and the art and animation is phenomenal.

The combos are very long, the characters are all very different and quite honestly the core game mechanic is, everything is cheap. Every character has unblockables and mix-ups for days and it’s a steep learning curve.\r I’ve always liked the more “basic” fighting games like Mortal Kombat, Injustice, Street Fighter or Killer Instinct.

The problem I have with this game is multifaceted. The most important one are the controls. The game does require a very precise timing to land all the tricks, but at least to me, the controls don't feel crisp enough to achieve this. There's just something off with the visual cues, controller input and whether or not you're successful in landing a jump to a point where luck seems to be involved more than skill. This particularly frustrating with landing a manual, where half the time you're on point, and half the time not for no apparent reason.\r Secondly, while there are a great amount of maps available, it doesn't alleviate the feeling of repetitiveness in the game.\r Bottom line, like someone before me mentioned, this game is at it's best when I start to feel like rummaging through the old boxes and fire up a Tony Hawk's for an evening or too.

I don't own a racing wheel and can't tune a one stringed guitar, much less a complicated, high performance race car.  I typically enjoy the arcade racers ranging from NFS to Drive Club.  I tend to shy away from sims because of the inherent frustration factor.\r All that in consideration, I have no idea why the hell I bought this game yesterday.   In part, I found the reviews intriguing...and the gameplay vids just looked incredible.  I enjoyed Dirt 3 but understand it leaned more heavily on style-over-substance side of things, drawing in us more casual gamers.  Great game with fun driving gameply but, by comparison, Dirt Rally is not the same.  The menus are almost spartan...minimalist compared to the NFS-like flash of Dirt 3.  The graphics are not nearly as gorgeous as Drive Club.  But, once I put in a few hours and got the hang of the extremely challenging, yet intensely rewarding drive physics....I was in heaven.  I don't even know how to describe it....it just feels pure.  All the graphical fidelity of this game is siphoned away from peripheral nonsense and focused right there where it should be in a game like this.....on the car and the dirt beneath it's wheels.\r For all you sim racer pro's, it's a no brainer, unless you just don't like rally racing at all.  For you racing casual gamers, I'd say if you like thrill of racers and have been craving something a little more nourishing than the what the arcade racers deliver...give this one a go.  No expensive racing wheel?  Don't let that stop you.  I just finished the first 60's championship series, finishing in 1st place....all with the dual shock 4 controller.  And, when I unlocked the advanced settings for tuning...I didn't touch a thing, leaving everything on default settings.  I'm sure I'll have to do some tuning down the road to stay competitive (thank heaven for YouTube gamer tips/tutorials!), but for now am doing just fine leaving the hardcore settings alone.",

Every song is A+.\r*Dancing zombies. Dancing. ****. Zombies.\r*Dancing is the core of the game - so you can't chicken out of it, like you do in real life.\r*Awesome boss battles - because beating bosses is the real deal.\r*Great singer for a shopkeeper - honestly, every shopkeeper in a game should sing like this.\r*Lots of characters to play with - each with it's own set of rules and custom soundtrack.\r*Lots of randomness - every time you play is unique.\r*Couch coop - so your girlfriend doesn't have to sit there watching your dumb moves.\r If you like roguelike games like Nethack or Roguelegacy, you're totally buying this. The Bard character actually makes the game very much like nethack (turn-based).\r Is it hard? Yes, it is. VERY hard. Unforgiving, even. But so is life!\r If you follow a strict completionist diet, don't buy it though: NO ONE has managed to get the platinum out of this, it's INSANELY difficult. The only way to do it probably involves ressurrecting MJ to teach you some moves. So, yeah. It's hard.\r Only problems i have are with some weapons that attack sideways when you actually wanted to move to another square. This results in some frustrating deaths.  And the lack of custom songs (pc version has this, i believe).\r Overall: 8,5. But i'll review it 9 because yeah.",

This story line, while written well, interesting, and captivating at times, is just the cherry on top of this game’s gameplay, music, and visual effects,\rCrypt of the Necrodancer is a rogue-rhythm dungeon crawler that consists of four zones, each with three randomly generated levels and a boss battle. You must complete all of these in order to set a checkpoint in the game and proceed onto the next zone. Each time you die you are reset to the beginning of the first level in the zone. Now, throughout the levels you will find and purchase upgrades like any fantasy dungeon crawler including health, weapons, armor, spells, and enchanted items. Permanent and new upgrades are available for purchase, with diamonds that you have found in the crypt, in the lobby of the game, from characters you save from sick beat prison in zones you have completed. These permanent upgrades include the essentials like better armor, weapons, spells etc. However most of these purchased upgrades come in the form of chests that can be found within the crypt zones, excluding health upgrades which you will automatically have added on in the beginning of each zone. These upgrades can be extremely helpful and can make all the difference in whether you complete a zone or rage out.\rThe game can become fairly difficult and kind of frustrating, especially when you’re first jumping into it. The rhythm aspect of the game and the way the almost “Zelda-esque” grid-style combat is set up, provides a really fun challenge for players; punishing you by sending you back to the beginning of the randomly generated zone but rewarding you by letting you listen to the music again and again, as you will die a lot. And if you like a bit of an extra challenge you can choose to not pick up weapons or health, and even jump on floor tiles that will either speed up or slow down the tempo of the song. And if you find yourself needing some help, the game supports local co-op play, which makes for a great “couch co-op” experience. Once you get the hang of the movement, and rhythm mechanics, you begin to notice and appreciate the crème-filling of the game, the music and visual effects.\rIt is hard for me to overstate how much I enjoyed what this game did with music. The soundtrack of the game itself is amazing and something I’ve found myself wanting to listen to outside of the game. However I did find myself getting rather upset playing through it the first time, dying then having to listen to the same song on the soundtrack over and over again. So my recommendation would be to either not die ever, or download some of the other soundtracks that have been released as DLC. If you decide to get the game on the recent port to PS4 these downloadable soundtracks are included with the game. But don’t let that be the deciding factor in whether you get the game on PC or PS4, as the PC version has easily my favorite feature of the game: MP3 Uploads. On the PC version you can upload any of your MP3 files, the game will analyze the tempo and allow you to play with your own music. This feature is not new to games, but feels brand new and refreshing when defeating giant dancing monsters to your favorite song or even playing through the whole game to a favorite album. And I know some of you may have just a laptop with no gaming potential, and may fear that you will never get to play this game. Well you’re wrong. The simplistic 8-bit art style of the game allows for optimal performance on any platform, not to mention it looks great.\rNow while the 8-bit art style may look great, it is a style that has been used a lot in the past few years and has somewhat lost its luster of being a “new-retro game”, and the nostalgia factor is just not there anymore. That being said, the use of contrasting color in this 8-bit world creates a beautiful game. The zones are almost exclusively darker toned color palettes to set the scene of being in an underground crypt, but each monster when illuminated by your small torch brings vibrancy and brightness to the world. Not only this but when you kill a monster, your coin multiplier begins, and any time your coin multiplier is active, the crypt floor turns into an ever changing disco dancefloor. So while the art style maybe a bit over played, Crypt of The Necrodancer finds a way to make it fun.\r 7/10 For PS4",

When you first load up BF4 you'll realize how life-like the graphics appear all the shades and minor details like characters models and  weather effects make the game satisfying to look at. The sound effects of weapons and vehicles sound realistic to there nature and none sound the same. The destruction is debatable however, While DICE wanted to utilize the destruction for a tactical advantage rather than a normal feature making BF4 destruction and explosions pretty to look at but nowhere near as good as Bad Company 2. The combat in the game is slightly altered meaning that if you kill an enemy your  rewarded points and this contributes to your'e overall score sort of similar to BF4\rs multiplayer. Ammo boxes refill the players ammo and let you use any gun you unlocked right from that point on. Both the games friendly and enemy a.i Have been improved from Battlefield 3's the enemy a.i will lunge grenades at you sometimes to flush you out and if you throw a projectile they will attempt to run away. Most of the times the enemy soldiers are communicating to each other and would try to shoot you from a far almost never moving up, They also take cover and fire on the player and squad. You can also order your squad mates (or any other friendly soldiers encountered) To engage a specific target you would also be awarded points for every squad kill. The campaign mode features characters that feel alive and each differing in their own ways and actions. The game has the standard explosion set piece but also includes really dramatic moments that can be very inspiring or very upsetting, It has some hidden messages such as \"the horrors of war\" and \"power corrupts\"  The campaign is entertaining and actually makes you carry about the characters and the story line. Multiplayer allows you to customize the look of your soldier and his weapons. Then partake in large infantry battles with some vehicles. Overall it's a great game and doesn't fall short like Call of Duty.",

No.  Why should you kill something that is no threat to you?\r The reputation thing - far too easy to end up with a grab bag of reputation.  How can I have a reputation for honesty and deviousness?  Wouldn't it be a sliding scale?\r Unplayable.  I'm in Act II and I have decided to try to sell it.",

                "review": "DOOM is a first-person shooter that can be compared to very few modern games of its genre. Where most shooters rely on cover and practical tactics in a gunfight, DOOM thrusts the player into the role of an unstoppable destroyer where there is no reload, there is no aiming down the barrel or crouching behind cover because the best strategy is always forward. The combat is kinetic and has you charging through demons with bombastic and beautiful weaponry. There is a grace to the movement, a momentum that builds as you carve through hordes of Hell’s minions across a detailed depiction of a colonized Mars where industry is centered around scientific research and the excavation of resources. There was instantly a feeling of familiarity to DOOM, but that familiarity quickly evolved and blended into refreshing gameplay that exceeded all my expectations.\rThere is no beginning tutorial or opening cinematic, it is within thirty seconds you kill your first demon and the action does not slow down from there. DOOM understands its identity, making it transparently clear that the gameplay comes before all else.\rThe combat is brutal and swift. Armor, ammunition and health are scattered through the levels that quickly become arenas of demon slaying. You run through these areas, fighting and scooping up supplies while methodically weaving between charging enemies and demonic energy blasts. Damage compounds quickly in DOOM and the gameplay continuously thrives in the moment to moment action, forcing the player to rush enemies because every close quarters kill comes with a splash of blue orbs to grant health and loads of ammunition to refill your arsenal. There is a relentless need to push forward and it creates spontaneous decisions that can spread into a mesmerizing chain of kills.\rHell is not scary. Hell is bad ass. Heavy metal music is sprinkled expertly throughout the game, electric guitar and beating drums adding intensity to each fight and enhancing the jaw dropping visuals with tone setting instrumentals. Mars is a mesmerizing depiction of the red planet turned to a harsh industrial zone, blood splattered hallways and towering steel structures your battleground in cleansing the demon threat. Hell is built upon boiling magma, constructs of skull and bones beneath a cloudy sky of crimson as a backdrop to your war against the wicked monstrosities that occupy the underworld. Every scene, every room is imaginatively crafted to further deepen the tenacious vibe of DOOM.\rDOOM allows you to become well acquainted and dangerously efficient with the weapon of your choice. The style and feel of each gun differ greatly and are effective depending on the enemy, situation, or equipped upgrades. You’ll find lasers, explosions and more yours to wield as your collection builds and the joy of finding a new weapon always comes with a rabid excitement to use it against the next wave of demons in your path.\rThe side characters and the DOOM slayer are interesting parts of the puzzle, yet it is the enemies that are the centerpiece. New demons are precariously introduced in each level, starting small and simple and advancing into more complex designs and mechanics as the campaign goes on. These demons keep surmounting until you’re fighting a vast variety of different monsters in one battle, multiple enemy types forcing you to adapt and master your craft. Some may charge you and disposing of them is as simple as sidestepping to shoot them in the soft flesh of their back while others hurl energy blast and smash the ground to knock you away when you get close to make battling them a combination of flanking and firing. These fighting styles require different tactics to win and learning and applying these techniques while battling ten different kinds of enemies establishes a sense of pride when finally overcoming the horde of hell’s monstrosities.\rDOOM is both comfortingly familiar and refreshing original, rebuilding a classic from the ground up to reestablish a brand that seemed forgotten in the modern age. A pedal to the floor, heavy metal vibe immerses the player in a crazy dystopia of demon slaying joy that never loses its flavor through the sprawling campaign. Atop the adrenaline inducing gunplay, imaginative demons, stellar soundtrack and brilliant level designs, there is an abundant amount of secrets to be found and an intriguing narrative hidden just beneath the surface. DOOM puts gameplay before all else and reinvigorates a dormant franchise with an entry that will spark an entire generation of new fans in this creative reimagining of the classic shooter.",

Only 4 seconds into the game you're called into action and from then it just doesn't stop. Weapons are satisfying to use and the shotguns carry a punch that leaves you grinning ear to ear. Little touches like familiar sounds and the red boxes for ammo just bring back nostalgia by the bucket load.\r I wasn't sure how I would like the Glory Kill system but believe me, when you start using it, it'll be your preferred method of killing - seeing how the monsters are ripped apart by your own bare hands, managing to get some health along the way.\r A few frame-rate issues to date and a little tearing here and there, which you barely notice as you combat the hordes of monsters running towards you. I have also tried multiplayer but it's early days and there was severe lag. I'm hoping this is improved with time (much like PS4's DriveClub) but early impressions are good - it's a no-frills old-school multiplayer game, just this time over the internet rather than serial-to-serial on PC in 1993.\r It's been said this game will mostly attract fans of the original DOOM and DOOM II and that's probably true, but if you want a 'no thinking just shoot' wrapped up with gorgeous graphics and gameplay, buy it!",

This, for Me, makes this My ATF (All-Time Fav) hoops game, & on the PS4 it's just absolutely gorgeous. The only gripe for true purists will be the over-the-top WWEish MyCareer mode which includes cheesy cut-scenes & the innately annoying knack for your counterpart to always be catching fire & carrying his team to an unrealistic degree. Having said that, when you're dropping 20 & 10 in your rookie showcase game you can understand the developers pushing your competition. For those who enjoyed catching fire in the heyday of NBA Jam you'll LOVE 2k14's varying levels of getting \"ON FIRE!!\", including defensively if you make a few good plays on D (steals, blocks, etc). The visuals are stunning, presentation is as realistic as I've ever seen & they even use the Real Voice feature to have real coaches & players during interviews. The online is a different twist on park hoops which allows you to watch & join games going on live by calling \"next\". There's more modes than you'll even have time for which makes for an overwhelmingly awesome full package. NBA 2k14 is the Best Basketball Game Ever. Good luck NBA Live!!! lol",

They constantly let guys drive past them for easy layups. Then your C or PF will attempt to block the shot after it's passing through the basket. Also, more teams like the Detroit Pistons will shoot 68% in the 3rd and 75% in the 4th quarter to either make a comeback or prevent you from catching their lead. Even when the defense does play \"D\" the CPU player will still score at will or get cheap falls, while you man is standing staight up with his hands raised. This is total BS. The CPU still gets tons of OR, but at least you team does now as well. In NBA 2K13 you player would get 4-6 OF, while the CPU would get 10-15. This happened almost every game you played. MY game also freezes sometime while checking the stats. No idea why. I've cleaned the disk several times and it still happens once in awhile. The game can still be fun and I like how they interview players on the floor and the whole story presentation is cool as first. I'm a little pissed that they removed the drills.

I will be more honest, however, and say that I probably would never have finished the game if I didn't have an extremely detailed game map open on my computer while playing... this game does not hold your hand, point you in the right direction, or give you a single hint as to what to do in most instances. It's a 2D side-scrolling open-world RPG like Skyrimvania and once you get hooked, it's nigh impossible to put it down. I found myself so helplessly engrossed in the world, lore, and experience that even two months after first picking it up, I still find myself falling in love with more elements I'm just now discovering. I simply cannot recommend playing this game enough but I do have to recommend using a cheat-sheet to get the most out of your enjoyment (at least based on my own personal experience). And for 20 bucks or less, you'll get your money's worth and so much more. I'd be happy to pay a full 60+ for this game simply because of how much Team Cherry takes care of you. Buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever. Just play it.",

Searching every book and cranny for collectibles and upgrades is rewarding more then annoying.  Not much direction on your journey and there will be lots of back tracking which can sometimes be tedious. Upgrading your knight and finding charms to make you stronger can be challenging but rewarding.  Enemies are abundant and difficult.  Bosses are each unique and challenging, just like in bloodborne you will die a lot and is advantageous to learn got enemies moves. Hollow Knight is a beautifully dreary game with lots of character.

Its biggest flaw IMO is the bad lip-syncing (not surprising given the budget of the game but better lip-syncing certainly would've helped). User control over the core rewind power you have could also feel more responsive. The graphics and art style work together well, and I never thought the game needed much more detailed textures. Certain music in the game contributed greatly to the emotion, while still sticking to the theme of the general soundtrack. I couldn't recommend the game enough if you enjoy a really good plot in video game medium.

This time it's handcrafted so it's even better. The platforming is top- notch, every cave is different with a unique theme, and the fact that you have to find the cave in the first place to then complete it, to then get the rewards make it ultra satisfying. Back tracking into the caves after getting new abilities to find hidden items is ultra satisfying. Looking for hidden areas after exploring and hearing that jingle just to get more cogs never gets boring to me, ultra satisfying. The main theme of the game digging underground with an axe to get to next objective while also mining for resources to upgrade your weapons is ULTRA satisfying and ADDICTING. Mining for resources is soooo addicting and everytime there is a tile with resources I never hestitate to go take a detour and hack away just to get $3. The world is also very colorful and fun to look at. The story while takes a back seat to gameplay builds around the mystery of the main character from the first game, so to me it's fine (since gameplay is so addicting). It took me 12 hours for one playthrough, but to others it might only be 6-8. To end, I love this game, love this series, it's not for everyone but to me it's a must play.

I like the tone of the game but the characters aren't as memorable as Steamworld Heist especially the towns people. Story is simple, I think one more plot point would have made it feel like a complete arch. Exploring the mines though is where it's at. Digging around trying to find a path to your objective and making sure to get loot on the way is the core of the game. There is combat but it's a side dish. I do want to point out that I think the light mechanic is unnecessary.  So, you have a lantern and fuel runs out pretty quick usually before you even have a full bag of loot to sell. What happens when it runs out is that the surrounding area gets really dark. It's cumbersome but you could power through it if you want. Or just go back to town. There's really no purpose in watching your fuel meter because the punishment for running out is so minimum. If they made it so you couldn't survive long without light and forced you to make sure you were near a checkpoint (tube back to town) while running low that could have been an interesting mechanic. What's funny is that this whole mechanic only exists in the early game because eventually you can get an upgrade so your fuel never runs out. So, what was the point in having it in at all? Idk. Minor gripe. Also the end was super frustrating! But I did feel really good after beating it. Good game. Recommended 7.5/10",

It has a great story that featuring funny, happy, sad, dramatic and tragic moments. Also has great gameplay, interesting mini games like Tetra Master and Chocobo Hot and Cold, and has one of the toughest superbosses of Final Fantasy games.

                "review": "To start this review I would like to say that I probably spent most of the time in my childhood playing this game above all others. I had at least 1000 hours over multiple save files and multiple playthroughs. So believe me when I say that this remaster is very, VERY disappointing.\r The nature of a remaster means that we cannot rate the game based on game content that was part of the previous iteration of the game as that would just be redundant circlejerking (if you want the original reviews they are still on metacritic). Instead we must only rate the new/remastered content and the content that should have received a remaster.\r 1st off: Graphics. This has got to be some of the laziest s*** I have ever seen. The backgrounds in towns actually appear to be worse than the ps1 original. The only parts of the overworld that got an actual rework were the character/enemy models (to their credit those were actually well done). The battles are a disjointed mish mash of frame rate drops and awkward 60 fps damage pop ups that are actually quite distracting. The cutscenes are exact pulls from the ps1 version with no smoothing or even upscalling AT ALL. Finally I would like to know why the font  is set to \"I have the eyesight of a molerat\" size for EVERYTHING.\r 2nd: Music. The soundtrack received absolutely NO remaster at all. Take this as you will but if im gonna buy a remaster I like to have the soundtrack reworked with an option to switch to the original.\r and 3rd: Gameplay. There are built in cheats for the game that are accessible through the pause menu and the config menu. I understand that this was originally set up as an iOS game and as such cheats to speed progress would be a boon to people who just want a casual time waster while commuting. They do however drain all the fun from the game for people looking for an actual gameplay experience. I urge you to play without the cheats at least once. Other than the cheat menu there are no real changes to the battle system. The analogue movement has been removed which results in clunky overworld movement but that is more of a quality of life thing and not really a hindrance to gameplay. The addition of trophies however was nice and definitely increases replay-ability.\r As a person who wanted this game remastered for so long, I find myself very saddened by the cheap and heartless way this game was reborn. ESPECIALLY in light of how beautifully ff12 was done. If you are new to this game I urge you to play the original ps1 version (available for the psp, psvita and ps3 on the psn for 6 dollars). If you are an old fan then you may get some enjoyment out of it but don't go into it thinking that this is gonna be anywhere near as good as the ff12 or even the ffx/x-2 remakes were.\r Overall I give this game a 5.",

It really is a return to the PS2 glory days for PES. FIFA is going to have to step its game up a hell of a lot from the lackluster demo they put out if they want to out do Konamis effort!\r Absolutely superb in every way:\r -Graphics are amazing, even the community created kits look great.\r-Option files are incredibly easy to setup with the added bonus of being able to pick and choose leagues/teams to add.\r-The AI is a challenge, especially in Master League, been enjoying some battling results with the default team. The AI plays in different ways, tries different tactics, it really is a joy.\r-Goalkeepers, a huge step forward from 2016. From the start they are a million times better. Animations, intelligence, everything.\r-Gameplay, it actually plays like a football game. Its not the frenetic through ball and pace fest of FIFA thankfully. You can play in the style that you want or that best suits the players at your disposal. Glorious.\r-Online. Not tried it a lot so far, been too busy with ML, but the few games I have played have been solid connection wise with no issues. Hoping that is a sign of things to come as PES has traditionally been difficult to play online since 2013.\r Basically, if you have a PS4 and love football, this is the game to get. Go get an option file, setup the game how you want to and enjoy it. Thankfully, the option file is a barrier for all of the squeakers that populate FIFA's FUT as they don't have the attention span to do anything other than put a disc in the console :) But for the rest of us who want a proper game of football, this is about as close as you are going to get short of digging out your boots and getting down the park!\r 10/10, a joy to play!

Because IMO a football game should be about the football and the features are a bonus. If a game is touting it's features over it's on pitch gameplay then you have an issue, which is Fifa all over, especially the last couple of years.\r I have thoroughly thrashed through about 70 games, mostly on My Clubs and mostly against online opponents because playing opponents online should be the main goal of any football game and to deliver the best experience possible. This should be the foundation of any football game because multiplayer gameplay was one of the original core elements of football games and I'm going back to the likes of Sensible Soccer and The original Fifa even the first attempt at a 3D-ish football game and one of my favorites International Soccer commodore 64 and the first PES games which if I remember were called International Star Soccer or something very like that. This is only to name but some, there are a few I could ass but for reference I'll stick to the mainly known.\r Gameplay\r So let's get down to it, PES 2017 is all about Gameplay Gameplay Gameplay. The more you learn about the game then the finer points come out and like any football game, it's the finer points than can make or break a game.\r This game is 95% perfect when it comes to gameplay and I've had a vast experience with football games. It's the best football game I have ever played. It actually is enjoyable to play and not just a frustration fest that has become Fifa games for the last few years.\r Scripting\r The bane of many Fifa players  :'(\r Well I can report in over 50 online games of mainly My Club there was no evidence of scripting. There were some frustrating  moments as any football match but all with in the realms of just user ineptness and bad luck.\r \"Special Match\" Scripting Test  :+1 There is a time in My Club that when two players of same ranking score meet each other, the game declares a special match, where 2x Credits are rewarded and it seems other items for my one game.\r The Special Match that you want to win was really the test for scripting with two equal players if the game favored one over the other for some reason it would stand out, like in a Fifa game.\r The short it was a very tight match with me having a slight advantage in my performance, I had more possession 60-40 and more shots at goal, my 5 to his 3. But we both had only 1 shot on target. But his one shot on target was a goal.\r Now felt I had the better of the game which the other guy agreed with but to be fair a draw was the fairest result but I ended up losing.\r But at least I wasn't blowing a fuse at the game robbing me. It felt a completely natural outcome.  I even sent a message of congratulations to my opponent. But has the loser of the Special match, I was still awarded with double losing Credits and a Special Trainer. I can only assume as the winner you may get an even bigger prize apart from double credits.\r AI & Game Modes\r I lumped the AI into game modes because like Fifa there is an array of single player ones so your opponent is the AI. But unlike Fifa were playing Doncaster or Real Madrid feels the same when it comes to what the computer is trying to do. By this I mean, if you take the star players out the computer is still playing in the same game pattern and style but obviously the better individual players can pass and shoot better.\r AI and teams in PES 2017 have they own styles and it's very noticeable and clearly stands out even when only playing against 4 different AI  teams.\r Overall Score 9/10",

                "review": "Updated Review  (9/24/16)\r PES2017 offline is the absolute best footie game I've ever played outside of PES 5 + 6. Online this is absolutely criminal. The gameplay is noticeably slower than offline and you can have better camera settings. The button lag is really bad, as others have stated the lag cheaters have started to come out of the woodwork again. The fact that 4 out of every 5 matches you play RM, BM, MU, MC, Chelsea, Juve, or Barca is appalling. I'll keep it because to enjoy master league but it looks I'm going to have to go back to Fifa ONLY for an enjoyable online experience and that really really makes me sad :( I literally watched my score go from 820 all the way to 695 all because I consistently play five star teams with ultra skilled players where the imbalance is always slanted to the better team. If you all can manage team imbalance and a reward system for players who work their way up with hard work as opposed to rolling people with Barca all the time then you've got a winner on your hands for years to come. For example in online competition it should be once a team is selected that team is no longer available. This will cutback on seeing Real Madrid six times in a row and require players to use another team and then it'll balance itself out. For Online Divisions you should have a MUCH lower score if you win with a powerhouse I'd say 75-95 points max you could use a powerful team to possibly stay up in a division if you need those 75 points as opposed to relying on them the whole season. The more skilled a player is with a lesser team it should count towards their world ranking and this would alleviate a lot of this over selecting of certain teams in this and addition to an on screen selection of teams between two players before a match would do wonders. For the lag cheaters anytime a game is ended for disconnection a point a piece should be awarded or there needs to be a ban system similar to the game Overwatch.\r I'd still give it an 8 on the strength of how well it plays offline but online they've got to do a little sprucing up otherwise this would be a 10. FYI I'll still keep my copy of PES because Master League is so enjoyable!",

There's quite a selection of music genre, and you might even get hooked on some songs that are not of a genre you typically listen to just because they're so darn catchy. This is a Korean game, so you will encounter Korean songs and some with broken English but who cares. The music is very well-done.\r This is the best release of the DJMax series thus far. It's hard, there are no gear effect compensations from previous versions (like protection from breaking your combo) so a full combo means a lot more than what it used to. The song collection is MASSIVE, and they have been putting out plenty of DLC to cover previous versions of the game. Furthermore, they're doing DLC partnerships with the likes of Rayark, which I find to be really cool.",

I will say in summary this game will not be for everyone but for hardcore RPG fans this is a must buy hidden gem of 2017 just don't let the weak  opening 20 mins of the game but you off.",

I also hope newer titles go for a more improved artsyle, or showcase better graphics overall. The opportunity is there. They should take it.\r Note: I played the PC version.

The businesses of the 2 main protagonists are also interesting, especially the cabaret club. Some mini-games are also really well designed. I recommend to try those ones in priority: Karaoke, disco, the sega arcade games, telephone club, bowling and pool.\r I repeat the fact that the story is really engaging and this is something uncommon in most of the other video games I played. I'm afraid I will always have higher expectations now for the stories after I've played Yakuza 0\r My heart would like to give 10/10 to this game but my mind tell me I can't because of a few cons. Here they are:\r1. Graphics look like PS3 or even PS2 sometimes (don't play this game for the graphics)\r2. Some mini-games are not really polished or relevant (didn't like the pocket car racing or the cat fight)\r Otherwise, this game is perfect and I highly recommend it. I would recommend playing the main story + the substories + the business part + a few mini-games.

It's definitely a highly recommend on my list If you're a person who hasn't played MLB the show series for a good while, And when I say a good while i mean the ps3 MLB the show days. I did, however, play MLB 15 the show and didn't particularly like it. But this one has gotten a good old groove back. While having multiple modes to play with like the ever so popular Road to the show, this time it has added commentary in the back and guides you through what it's like to be a professional ball player. nothing so innovative but at the same time, it's a good change.  And when you're trying out to be drafted it's always fun to compete with your friends to what team you get drafted by. I was chosen by the New York Yankees affiliate squad and felt at awe when they chose me. lol however if you don't like what team chooses you, you can always opt out and wait it out a year or more by choosing to go to college. it's really interesting all the new aspects they've shown. The graphics are definitely polished and clean looking and wonder how they would fair if you had a ps4 pro. And also the new game mode that I've barely gotten my hands into is Diamond Dynasty seeing that I'm fairly new to this mode I decided to buy some packs and man was I hooked. it feels like playing Ultimate Team on Fifa. It sure is fun, seeing what players or accessories you pull. Even though they cost money, or you could grind out and use your own stubs.  Overall I'm  pleased with all the new additions they've made and how you can seamlessly change the settings to how you would like to play the game. If you've come from the old mechanics when guessing the pitch and choosing what strike zone they will through. I definitely think this is a must if you're a baseball fan.",

Loved the new fielding animations, extremely loved the new ball physics, loved the new ways you can get a hit (grounder between 1st and 2nd). However the graphics to the gameplay (especially hitting) feels off, almost like its arcadey now. In mlb 16 when you hit a line drive up the middle you smoked it, in this game it feels like \"pew pew pew\" slow liner up the middle. Hitting this year also feels way more luck based than prior years, you center a recticle on a high fastball to and get \"good\" timing to get a bloop fly to shallow center? Theres like 25% more lag in online play than mlb 16, the whole rewards aren't as fun to achieve as last year. New modes like retro and revamped story rtts is nice, but it's icing on a cake (and i don't like icing). Difference asside from last years the show, as a baseball fan I can't complain nor should any baseball fan, it's the same game and same studio, just not as good as last years imo.",

Time Consuming and One Hell of A Learning Curve.\rMLB The Show 17 is a pretty looking game lost in a myriad of glitches, grinding and repetitive disappointment.\rPitching is too easy, batting is too hard. Batting in this game takes so much enjoyment out of this game I just can't justify putting any more time into it.\rI experienced a number of unacceptable glitches whilst playing, actually grinding in RTTS.\rIn the developers defense, they supported the game well after release but it was still a very unpleasant experience.\rThe Show 17 isn't a bad game, it just isn't very good and it would take a die-hard baseball fan to put the time and dedication into it to get past the 100s of issues that impact the fun you could be having playing something else.\rI've reinstalled it a year later and my opinion hasn't changed.\rOverall pretty disappointing, can't even trade it because I got it from PSN.  5/10",

Every android has unique weapons and character, some of them are unlockable by beating bosses. Story is simple but interesting to follow, spiced up with funny situations and dialogues. Game also offers infinite waves mode and up to 4 players couch co-op (online play is not included). There is also some unlockables to keep you busy, if you into such things.

The pitching and batting mechanics are brilliant but the real winner is the ego mode. it is BRILLIANT. It gives the game depth, complexity and toughness. With a different ego setting every game will be different.\r The second best thing are the teams, they are hilarious. not only does each team have its own specialty (ie. hitting,power,defence pitching) but the players are unique (to a certain extent) and you can fully customize how they look if you arent impressed by Metalhead's creations. With each team having their own strenghts and weakenesses you can really empower them in season mode with coaches.\r The coaches are well thought out, you get new ones as you level through the season (these levels carry on to new seasons too!) which give you modifiers on your players. These modifiers change depending on what team you choose and you can't select all the coaches at one time as you are limited by your level (and new one keep appearing as you level up.) There is also an attraction rate, so you are doing well and not firing coaches before the contract expires you can get more and more to choose from.\r This game is brilliant, i can't stop playing it, it is 20$ on ps store and just came out with new diamonds in a dlc pack for free.

But alas, this dream has not come true, and it likely never will. It would be WAY too awesome, which is why I know it will never exist.\r Anyhoo...\r Super Mega Baseball is not an abject failure, but it's barely more than a cell phone game. You cannot adjust the game's difficulty once you've begun a season, at least not that I'm aware of. You cannot adjust individual difficulty. In other words, you can't have hitting be set to one level, while pitching is set to something else, fielding set to another difficulty level, etc. etc. Because you can't adjust the difficulty level while in season, your stats get really unrealistic. I'm 20 games in and I still have players batting over .500 on my roster. The game mechanics are really wonky and not intuitive at all. The between-game interface is weird.

Exploration is also even more rewarding this time, with a perfect mix between new attractions and the revamped fan-favorites that have been a staple of the series.

As with all the Yakuza games, it is open world done right as it's map is not a massive one that you'll find in most open world games but is smaller and jam packed with things to do as there is no wasted space in the game and makes the cities of Kamurocho and Sotenbori, the game's two setting's, feel truly alive and lived in. I have known about the franchise since it's PS2 days but always overlooked it as I thought it was simply Japan's inferior version of the GTA franchise, it wasn't until January of this year when I was given Yakuza Kiwami that I discovered how very wrong I was and since have played every Yakuza game available to PS4 and can't get enough. Yakuza Kiwami 2 is by far the best entry in franchise to date and shows publishers what a remaster can and should be. Running off the new Dragon Engine, which was created for Yakuza 6, the game runs smoothly allowing you to run in and out of buildings with mostly no load screens when your just exploring the city. The graphics are top notch from the many buildings and bright neon lights of Kamurocho to the more calm and subtle Sotenbori. The combat is more akin to Yakuza 6 than to the first Kiwami as you do not have combat styles, but has a deep upgrade system that adds plenty to Kiryu's and Majima's skillset. You can also equip up to three weapons you can pull out in battle and three pieces of gear to help bolster your defense and give you more resistance to knives and guns. The mini games are as always fun and enjoyable from Karoke, to a weird one where you take pictures of models, two golf minigames, and even classic SEGA arcade games that will keep you occupied for several hours. It also brings back the Clan Creator minigame from Yakuza 6, adding some new features to it and has it's own storyline that is quite enjoyable. The story is pretty much the exact same as the original PS2 game but adds a brand new story featuring fan favorite Goro Majima and serves as a sort of epilogue of his Yakuza 0 story, although you don't unlock the first chapter of his story until you complete chapter 5 of Kiryu's story. Both Kiryu's and Majima's stories are some of the best the franchise has seen thus far and will have you laughing, clinching your fists, sitting on the edge of your seat, and maybe even teary eyed. The game also has side quests called sub stories that are all worth completing, as some are some of the craziest and weirdest stories you'll ever see in a game, and completing them reward you with new allies, gear, weapons, experience and more. You can complete this game in about 20 hours if you focus strictly on story and don't do much exploring, but you'll see very soon that would be a waste as there is easily another 50+ hours of side content for you to enjoy. This is one of the best games of this console generation and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for something with a great story and brilliant characters.",

Everything from the improved combat, to the minigames and more of the returning and new extra side content in Yakuza 2/ Kiwami 2! I am so happy that I played this game for 14 hours straight, and the best part of this game is the new moves and heat actions as well as for the story and my god I really loved the story in this game it is probably one of the best in the series in my book and its really good than 0's story especially when the story was a little darker and more connected from the Jingwoen Mafia and Goda Ryuji the best rivalry/ antagonist ever in the Yakuza series. But overall I really have nothing to complain about the game other than the fact that Majima's story was very short but that's about it. Anyway, it's a fantastic game I highly recommend it!",

Eventually you will meet people along the way, helping you further your quest to finally beating the game(if you ever can).

The goal of the game is to get gold, level up, explore the randomly generated castle, and beat the bosses when prepared. Also when your character dies, they do not come back, and you must continue your adventure with one of three children. the game is also very changing, but its deigned around being challenging. However, their are several downsides to the game. There isn't much enemy variety. There are at least 10 different types of mages, 6 different types of skeletons, and 7 different types of floating eyeballs. Also most of the bosses are based on another enemy in the game. These i feel are not very large problems, and there are defiantly more than 3 different types of enemies, but it still holds the game back.

After experiencing it myself and becoming addicted, I would have gladly paid $100 for this. It's just that good. I can't put it down.\r The soundtrack has been completely remastered and sounds utterly incredible. Playing this game with good headphones feels like a dream. Have you ever paused a game because it looked and sounded so good it overwhelmed you? That's WipEout Omega, AND there's a photomode...\r Everything feels polished to the max here. There is no better WipEout experience than this. I'm crying, it's so good. Best racing game I've played in years.",

                "review": "So WipEout Omega Collection, What a Remaster. i had both Games on Vita and PS3, and loved both of them, compare those 2 with this collection, besides THE GORGEOUS overhaul with the textures, making the text on the ships, the grounds and tracks readable and not blurry. ill do this review into parts\r Graphics: the Visuals are Stunning, though its only a Racing Game, its one of best looking on the ps4 as of right now. (Others come to mine include Driveclub, made by another First Party Sony Studio that is now closed). every second i just want to pause the game and use the inbuilt Camera Mode just to show off every aspect of the game. on the PS3 version it was blurry textures even though it was 1080p 60Fps as well. On 2048 for the Vita, with its small screen you could still tell how beautiful it was but was drowned out by the Resolution, in the Collection lets you see what everyone was thinking, 2048 on a bigger screen and it holds out. every second you see the texture on the roads/tracks and the logos/text on the ships, some things that you wouldn't have seen on the small screen of the Vita. There is added lens flares, and some bloom and glow from the lights around the track that make it even more beautiful than it was before. everything they have done is a plus in this department.\r Sound: with the Audio, its different situation from the original 2, the wines of the engines in 2048 that sounded like Star Wars Pod-racers (or Formula 1 cars) are now nearly non existent, the sounds are the exact same with HD/FURY and have No difference even when the years between the 2 are pretty far Apart. the Machine guns & mines Sound more like Pea Shooters than machine guns and the Bombs do not sound like they should, they sound more like the mines than a Sonic/thermal imploder from Star Wars (another Star Wars reference). that said, the sound will grow on me but would have preferred the more futuristic sounds from the originals.\r Music: The Music is just like other WipEout games but still could be improved, lucky though they include several tracks from the others which hits the spot. there is no custom music unless you use a USB Drive or Spotify, with this unlike WipEout 2048/HD it doesn't interact with the boosts and getting hit by things, but that doesn't matter because i normally turn that feature off anyway. there is 2 options that they have added where you can choose from the 2 types of music they have in the game.\r Campaign: the campaign i don't need to say anything if you already have played HD and 2048, as both are 1000% the same.\r Racebox: I'm So glad with this Racebox, not only its 100% identical to HD/FURY, it adds 2048 as well, unlike the original which only had the Campaign and Online which could only let you race pre-made races and events making it impossible to set a track, speed class and AI difficulty of your choice. but one thing i don't like is that you cant choose 2048 ships and use HD/FURY Tracks, which i knew wouldn't happen but would have been great using them on the other tracks than the default. (this goes for online as well. and i don't mean using 2048 ships against HD/Fury ships because that requires balancing and they said they didn't want to change the gameplay)\r Online: with Online the last game type, its also identical to HD/FURY which is a good thing, but you can now choose which game you want to create, be it 2048 or HD/FURY, each option lets you choose from the game modes from that game, and choose the ships from it as well, so you don't need to switch to a different game, if you are host you can switch in the settings for that lobby. this is also disappointing that Multiplayer doesn't have challenges like 2048 did, but also relieving that you don't need to choose a map and game mode from 2 randomly generated options.\r Ships: the ships in this are the same ones you have in HD/FURY and 2048, but they add extra liveries for 2048 and add 2 extra companies for HD/FURY (Tigron & Van Uber which are only available in HD/FURY), the detail on these ships are amazing, you can now zoom in as close as you want and you will see no pixels or blurry textures. when picking a ship you can turn the ship upside down etc to just admire them.\r Tracks: the tracks have been remaster perfectly, they look so good, and they play the same just like normal. the floors are pixel free and you will just drop your jaw in aw looking at the scenery.\r MISC: the controls are exactly the same but even better on a PS4 controller. photo mode is great and you just need to open the share menu to save instead of hiding the UI making it quicker than ever.\r Pros: great tracks\rgreat ships\rgreat campaign, racebox & online\ramazing replaybility\rstunning visuals\rspot on controls\reasy to learn\rPhoto mode is useful\r Mix:  music is great but could be better\rSounds have change not for the good or worst\r Cons: cant mix tracks and ships\rno Objectives in MP",

One is called conquest and allows users to play against the CPU to earn some of the best legends available in this year's release for their Diamond Dynasty Team.  The developers weren't stingy with rewards either.  Playing this mode allows users that prefer offline gameplay to earn some of the best legends in the game (among them Ichiro Suzuki and Tony Gwynn).  The animations are smoother and more realistic than last year.  There are animations and gameplay situations that could use smoother transitions to create more realistic gameplay but these do not detract at all from the single player experience at all.  Some of the still rigid and slow transitions in infield fielding and throws to the cutoff man are exploited in by some users in online gameplay.  One of the unique features that sets MLB The Show apart from other sports games is Sounds of the Show.  Sounds of the Show allow users to set walkup music, home run music and chants for each player in the MLB for a more realistic gameplay experience. The game allows you to import 511 mp3s from a USB into the game's jukebox.  This way when I play and feel like listening to music instead of the commentary, which is outstanding, I can listen to a shuffled playlist in game of an set of songs I choose.\rOne of the unique features of MLB The Show's Diamond Dynasty mode (similar to FIFA's FUT and NBA 2K's MyTeam) is that purchased in-game currency can be used to buy packs AND players.  This way if you dislike the gambling aspect of buying packs, you can purchase a calculable amount of \"stubs\" and purchase the team you want.  All modes of the game are entertaining and have high re-playability.  The fact that you don't feel like you're forced to gamble in the Diamond Dynasty mode makes it more enjoyable then other games with similar modes.    If you're a sports fan and haven't tried MLB The Show then I highly recommend it.  There are modes for franchise (many seasons of using a team), single season, Road to The Show (where you create a player to go from the minors to the major leagues).  The franchise mode has an online capability which is awesome.  You can use real rosters or you can fantasy draft teams with the game's 55 released to date legends.  Finally, the graphic detail and the stadiums is stunning.  Beautiful recreations of all MLB ballparks and some older parks along with fictional minor league parks give the game a high quality aesthetic experience.\r 10/10",

The gorgeous world, the calming ambient sounds, the enchanting music, the heartbreakingly cute little mouse Quill; all together that alone puts this game at the front of the VR games pack. Then the game play itself is satisfying and fun. You steer Quill with your controller stick and your own hand, represented by a sphere of light, by moving the controller. This feels like you're truly cooperating, a fact that the game also reminds you of in other different ways, like you giving Quill the world's most adorable high five after job well done.\r It's a platform puzzle game with combat, all of which escalates in a kind pace from learning the first step to more challenging puzzles, fights and jump action sequences. There were fights I died over and over, and there were timed jump puzzles I failed at an embarrassing amount of times, but I didn't feel frustration over it. I felt that all the times I failed it was because I didn't perform well enough. The controls and level design are solid and were not to blame. Not entirely at least, there were some moments towards the end where you kind of had to die once to understand what you were supposed to do. Regarding the controls there was one spot I had to spin a thing that for some reason was annoyingly difficult to turn, but for the most part it was smooth sailing.\r It's a short game, but I feel like it would be enjoyable to play again. There are a couple of things I know I missed that I want to find, and some tantalizing hidden trophies I'd like to sniff out.\r Finally a massive congratulations to the narrator Morla Gorrondona. She did an amazing job. Amazing. Probably half the magic of Moss is how she tells the story. Polyarc struck gold casting her.\r When you step into the world of Moss, remember to pause now and then and look around you. The world truly feels alive when you look up at the distant treetops, listening to the sounds of the forest. I'm going back there right now.",

Hoping PSVR 2 will have clearer graphics, wider field of view, better camera.  Untethered would be nice too.\r Frankly, the format of this game I think could be used in many other games, for instance, I could see them making VR Dark Souls games where you are moved to different locations as an observer and control the characters in front of you.  Very well thought out VR experience, hope it gets used by other developers.\r Bottom line.  If you own a PSVR headset then you need to add this game to your collection.

I originally played this masterpiece on my PC, a powerful rig with crossfired 7970's and a 2600K at 4.8Ghz. I thought that the game was visually exquisite on my configuration with TressFX etc all enabled and a stable performer, although even my rig couldn't escape frame dips from a v-synced 60fps in areas such as shanty town. I think the devs have done a commendable job porting this to the much weaker, but still very capable, PS4 with so many visual bells and whistles intact and expanded upon. The game truly is a sight to behold running at 1080p and a perceptively quite stable 60fps on my big 65 inch Panasonic.\r A lot of people/critics are marking the game down based on the price. This is unfair in my estimation. The 'game' is still a stellar AAA title, now with just more additional sheen. The practice of keeping the price high is something I understand the community's resentment over, but as far as ridiculous scores like 60% or below for the actual game itself I do not agree with at all.\r If you never knew the title was released prior and sat down to play it and review it on its own merits in this incarnation you would be undeniably impressed and the score should reflect that.\r If you're lucky enough to have never played it and own a PS4 buy it immediately, comfortable with the fact that you just purchased the best game on the system. But even if like me you have played it, and even if you played it on the PC where the advantages this version offers are slimmer, it still is worthy of heavy consideration. I personally loved the game first time round and had zero reservations about ponying up for it again on PS4. It is a double dip, but it is also one where you can see significant care has been made to update a lot of things graphically that is truly a rarity in similar double dip scenarios, where a resolution increase is about it.\r 10/10...on any platform.",

Another similarity is the way that you improved weapons; reload speed, capacity, damage, recoil etc. I really enjoyed upgrading my weapons and skills of my choice. Some of the skills have great animations, such as the close combat kills (reminiscent of Gears of War)\r So why an 8? Well as much as I had fun with this game, even to the point of collecting all extra items and completing challenges. I felt a little disappointed by the lack of sub-boss/boss encounters. I'd spent ages upgrading and preparing an amazing arsenal of weapons, expecting some extremely challenging encounters towards the end of the game but it simply never materialised.\r There are some great set pieces that  are reduced to simple 'quick time events' or taken over completely by the cut-scenes and you just watch. Why couldn't I have shot that enemy in the head with an arrow instead of watching it? I won't spoil the experience for anyone but there was another moment I was anticipating a tough boss battle, which I was prepared for, then it was all taken away from me by a cut-scene. Even the final boss felt like a bit of an anti-climax in terms of difficulty and input.\r This is where it falls short for me, Resident Evil 4's enemies became more and more challenging and were varied which simply wasn't the case here. The climbing and parkour was good, one of my favourite levels being the shanty town. Also use of the pick axe for climbing and scaling walls was great too. It's a great start for an origin reboot series, with much potential to improve for the sequel.  Unfortunately as a PS4 owner I won't get the chance to play it as it will be exclusive to Xbox One owners.  I picked this up for £18 and I had a lot of fun with it.",

                "review": "Just beated the game yesterday. Shadow tactics is the fantastic game that got huge inspiration from Commando, and Commando is my favorite game in my childhood so yes, I love Shadow tactics very much. The difficulty is very high, brutal sometimes but there are also a lot of possibilities to approach. You can adjust difficulty as well so it is fine for rookies to learn. Let see pros and cons.\r Pro\r1. Very well done commando style game - Shadow tactics inherits the soul of Commando in the right way and yet improve what was lack. For exp, handgun rarely be used in Commando because it will instantly trigger alarm. Now in Shadow tactics, it will not trigger alarm, but it has very loud voice and limited ammo\r 2.Good Story - I never expected the story but Shadow tactics did good job in this area, although it is little dark for my taste but I enjoy the conversation between comrades so far.\r 3.Shadow mode - very intuitive mechanic, It allows you to order all of your characters beforehand then let them commit their actions at the same time. This allows us to perform very high tactical engaging that we would never be able to do in the old commando.\r 4.Badge system adds a lot of replayabilities in this game.\r Cons\r1.Price is a little too high (40USD), since the graphic is not that great, I expected the price should be around 25-30 USD.\r 2.Only 13 missions. I was hope for 15 to 20.\r In brief, from a fan of commando like myself, Shadow tactics earns 9/10, a very solid score. In term of gameplay, they did everything right. 20+ hours from start to finish, I cherish every moment.  I will absolutely buy the sequel if they do. For those who never played this kind of game , there is a demo, you can try and see yourself. If you love challenging game and also strategy game, you don't want to miss this one. A remarkable gem indeed.",

                "review": "A very astute man patrols the walkway, lined with stone and shrubberies, ensuring his fellow colleagues are safe. A battle has emerged at the front gate, and it is a battle life or death for the guards of the fort. The walls are lined with gunmen, firing away at the invading army of the Shogun. On his way back home for the night, the guard feels the cold steel of a katana cut across his neck, and all so suddenly tastes the copper of his own blood as he slinks to the ground and is dragged into the very bushes he kept walking past unknowingly. An assassin was waiting for the perfect moment to strike, as the Shogun would surely rule this land.\r Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is a game that mixes two genres that go hand-in-hand: stealth and strategy. If there’s a genre that is most often either a hit or miss, it’s stealth. If the mechanics are off just enough, it ruins the entire game. Likewise, strategy can often be unplayable thanks to the difficulty and/or a lack of actual options. Luckily, this manages to harness the best from both genres, while also having a great story and plenty of replay value.\r There’s a lot that goes into the 13 levels you’ll be playing. While each one has a badge for completing it within a certain amount of time, (5 minutes, 15 minutes, etc), chances are you’ll be spending a lot more time than that. The first level took me about 45 minutes, and that’s not including all the reloading I did because I messed something up. The game allows for quick saves by pressing the touch pad, which only takes a few seconds. It keeps your three most recent saves, because we all know that when you save in a game like this, chances are you do so at a terrible time and need to rethink a portion of the game. This will save you so much frustration, and keeps the game fresh as you try different tactics in each level, as loading a quick save is near immediate.\r You start off with a ninja, but are soon introduced to a samurai and sniper, all of which you’ll end up controlling. As the game is constantly moving regardless of who you are, you need to ensure the characters are in safe spots when left alone. Crouched in a hidden spot is ideal, unless you’re keen on dying. This is a bit less of an issue if you’re killing everything in your path, but for those that are doing non-lethal playthroughs and only knocking characters out, the guards may come looking for you once they come to, and it doesn’t take them long to do so.\r Each of the five characters you gain control of has their own abilities, adding their own flare to each level. These include combat as well as distractions. When you are first introduced to a character, there are fairly obvious places to use them. The levels are designed to teach you their abilities if you are so inclined, although you don’t have to. The game is also sure to inform you of level specific features, such as riding in a wagon to get past guards or using the environment for kills. These will often factor into the badges for each level, and typically have a trophy attached. You’ll find that certain sections of levels are seemingly impossible without a bit of teamwork that you’d find in the likes of Modern Warfare with your AI sniper taking out the left as you kill the right. Luckily, the game offers a shadow mode that lets you set up an action per character, and lets you execute it at the perfect time with the press of the triangle button. This is extremely satisfying.\r The nice thing about the camera is it lets you view enemy patterns all around the level, and you can reset it back to who you’re currently in control of, which is nice as you can easily become lost in the maps. When wandering around, you will undoubtedly walk into an enemy’s vision cone that you overlooked. This will bring up a green cone that fills up with yellow until it reaches you, at which point it’s red and you reload your save. You CAN keep playing – you have life and whatnot – but with how often you save (the game reminds you ever minute and twenty seconds with a spiffy graphic) there’s really no reason not to reload. You are also able to view each enemy’s vision cone (one at a time) by pressing left on the d-pad, which allows you to get to the next bush at just the right time, or draw their attention and kill them just out of sight while their buddy surveys the area.\r If you are a fan of stealth or strategy, I highly recommend Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. It offers so much content, and presents it better than most games in the genres it covers. The only downfall is the camera, and it is a big one once you spend some time with it, but that’s hardly a reason to not play this. Mimimi Productions has created a gem of a game, and their future looks very bright.",

I say esoteric for a reason, because this will certainly not be everyone's cup of tea.\r There are a variety of characters with differing skills and equipment that can allow you to navigate through missions in a number of ways to suit your own style, although if your style is not stealth, then you are playing the wrong game. The downside of this also is that most missions will not have all five characters to choose from, limiting your choice a little, although this also works out for a smoother experience because despite their distinctiveness, some characters' skills do overlap.\r The learning curve here also comes from controls that can be fiddly at first because almost every button on the controller is needed, and commanding your team quickly can be challenging but achievable. Shadow Mode allows you to plan a move in advance, so that can help massively. Fortunately the game is very concise and helpful when introducing new characters and concepts with quick tutorials.\r The graphics aren't exactly pushing the PS4 to its limits, but they are still easy on the eyes. There can be a lot going on in the screen sometimes and this gets tricky but that's more down to the nature of the game rather than any flaws in graphics.\r There is a loose story in the game that is vaguely interesting, but you don't need to know it to enjoy the game as the focus is on the gameplay. There is some interesting character development, though.\r The gameplay is where a game like this really shines. It can be very challenging, but there are varying difficulty levels that can help a lot too. The normal difficulty setting is quite challenging and I probably would recommend the easy setting to get used to the controls if you get frustrated easily. One of the best facets of the game is the save system that is very fluid and allows you to save any time, which is a God-send when each move in a game like this can be critical. Plus, the game reminds you when you haven't saved your game in over a minute. Yes, it really is necessary to save that often.\r Overall, I found that this is a great game and the only real flaw was some repetition as the game progressed. However if that is not an issue then you will enjoy Shadow Tactics. Each mission can easily last over an hour and the friendly save system makes it addictive to want to go back and try again in various approaches to each level. Definitely recommended if you like a strategy-type of game or want something different.",

When I’m playing an RTS, I prefer games like the Total War series or Halo Wars where it’s controlling an army. This is much more, controlling one character at a time but having multiple characters on the map. So you’re switching between multiple characters, solving puzzles and stealthily attacking enemies.\r This is a strategy game but its just not the type of Strategy game that I am into. I do think it’s a well-made game but its just not for me.",

Well, in truth, I guess it is about these things, but what really gets my blood pumping is the race against the clock. Meticulously replaying each stage over and over and over until I've shaved every last tenth of a second and reached the very limits of my platforming skills. It has become an obsession.\r Undoubtedly, this will sound incredibly tedious to many gamers, but for me – and those who instinctively gel with SMB's nuances – it represents the very epitome of hardcore, twitch platforming.

Boi was i wrong to do so, the first time I started I was hooked and ended up beating it the next day but I wanted more. So I decided to 106% it along with getting the platinum trophy. So lets actually start the review.\r The story is nothing special you ( Meat Boy ) are trying to save your girlfriend ( Bandage Girl ) from the evil Dr Fetus and thats it but its funny because the cutscenes that are between chapters have some really messed up humour.\r The gameplay is absolutely incredible. The way Meat Boy controls is solid and the level layout is what makes this game fun. At first its simple but they slowly put in new objects, you are not told how to go about avoiding these so its all up to you and the level design. For example in salt factory missiles are added, at first these are a huge pain as you blindly jump about hoping they don't hit you but you suddenly realize theres a wall or that you can juggle them to hit a wall while you make your way to bandage girl making you feel like you accomplished something. Theres also different characters to be unlocked by collecting bandages or beating warp zones ( Which are awesome little throwbacks to the gameboy or consoles ) these characters have different abilitys like double jump or stick to walls.\r The difficulty curve is nice and if you beat the previous world you can beat the next. Not once did I think this isn't fair or why did I die as it was always my fault. Theres a dark world which is light world levels but revamped to be harder to give you even more of difficult time if you felt like the light world was to easy or try tackling the Iron Man Trophies/Achievements.\r All in all this game is great fun and if you are a fan of platformers then you need to play this now.",

There's a different theme and music score for basically every new foe you face. The slow pan down and narration when introducing each fight is some of the best presentation I've seen in a game for quite some time.  If you don't like visual novels, and a good amount of dialogue, this game might not be for you. However, these type of games aren't usually what I look for, either.\r The game is actually very challenging as well on hard mode. It always a good thing when you're getting worked up when the enemy completely crushes you. When I finally beat one of the fights I had been stuck on, there was a very awesome feeling of intense satisfaction... to me that's a sign of a great game.

The gameplay is a mix of occult with sports, sprinkled with some RPG elements, certainly unique but certainly not exciting.\r You play with your choice of three members for your team against another team of three, and to truly excel at the game you're expected to use all three members in synchronicity to perform quick passes, long range banishes and clutch saves. However, in my experience I could easily just use one character per round without any trouble leaving my other members standing idle probably contemplating how they're winning without any team effort on their part. Even when you do bother to utilize your teammates to the fullest, only being able to move one member at a time just doesn't click in what should be a fast paced sport/combat game.\r The game does have its positives, with fantastic visuals, great soundtrack, and the unique voice acting is perfect for every character. But with all that, when it comes down to it, it's core aspect just doesn't keep me itching to perform the next rite, nor care to hone my skills in the practice area.\r I had bought this because of the company's track record with Bastion and Transistor, but honestly I regret paying more than $10 for this.",

It feels too short but it was interesting, if they expand on it it could be the first sports game/RPG for some time.\r The con's:\r 1) Strength is just overpowered - players are free to shoulder charge you off the ball with no punishment - this becomes a much bigger issue on higher difficulties and online\r2) Bad AI.  In short EA is just too lazy to develop decent AI and, instead, just makes players perform way beyond there stats i.e. slow defenders catch up to 99 pace/speed players with ease.\r3) Offline mode.  Clearly this has been abandoned for years now - same title screens, same formula. complete lack of depth in terms of developing youngsters and having an academy, an utterly useless addition of 'controlling your budget' which basically is the same choose ratio of wages & spends.  All in all it feels exactly like '15 and '16 - not good enough,\r4) There are still issues over passing - the amount of times a pass will go to the exact player you do not want it to go to is ludicrous, it is so ham fisted and really detracts from the game.\r5) Career mode - same old problems - players randomly deciding they want to leave (usually your best players) - negotiations being very very basic (it doesnt have to be champ manager level but it could have a little more sophistication) - other teams just being terrible (2/3's of the way through a season and the 2nd place team has like 38 points its just stupid, make the good teams more competitive so I have so worry about actually losing a game. The list is endless for career mode honestly.\r In short my gripe is that, for a 'new' game, I expect new additions and features.  The only new addition that stands out is The Journey - everything else is just Fifa 15 & 16.  The offline play has had literally zero attention paid to it and we all know why: FUT.  I know this is popular, and I know EA make some serious money off of this, but it is not for everyone.  The offline game should be the basis of the  game not some after thought but, with Fifa, it is.  For me I wish I would have got a refund when I had the chance and just kept playing Fifa 16, honestly the differences offline are so small it would make little to no difference.  The game, in itself, if you ignore the previous titles, is probably a 6 or a 7 if your being very generous but it's the complete lack of  progress in the series that really grates - Fifa focuses all its effort on FUT and the rest of the game suffers.  They are milking the cash cow and it makes players, at least it makes me, feel ripped off.  I really don't think I'll buy Fifa 18 unless large scale changes to offline mode are made - if they don't I can just keep play '17:  if offline play is your thing I would choose another game as Fifa 17 just cannot cut it.",

When you through the back out the game steps in and assists with recovery, I matched the setting to my Dirt rally settings and it did not help. The car just seems to want to stay on the track and doesn’t have to be forced to stay on. The cars feel under powered and the sense of speed is gone. Hitting a random bump in the road and flying of track in to a tree at 100mph that’s rally that’s dirt rally. In dirt 4 when the car hits a jump or bump the physics feel heavy almost as if the track is magnetic. When in the air you can see the game forcing the car straight trying to land on either the left, right two or all four tyres as if those are the only 3 outcomes available instead of just letting the physics dictate it. The other users reviewing the game positively are newcomers and not hard-core fans, the applaud the games accessibility yet fail to see that the success of dirt rally was in its lack of accessibility. Hard-core gamers want hard-core games with no limitations in the physics to “assist” new comers, this game will never be competitive for this exact reason it’s not a level playing field. The entire gaming industry is threated by developers pandering to casuals for a quick buck instead of listening to dedicated life-long fans. It would not have been hard for Codemasters to simply add a Dirt rally handling option yet they have not….Why? because the physics don’t allow it. When I first heard of Dirt 4 I thought na it’s too good to be true this soon, I was proven right. The exact team who created dirt rally should be used for dirt rally 2 I don’t want to have to wait through another 3 of this trash before it happens. Come on codemasters you had it right with dirt rally all you needed to do was give us a few more tracks and cars and we would have been more than happy instead you pander to these scum casuals, even if you would have just gave us DLC for dirt rally I would have paid for it rather than waste money thinking this is it when it isn’t. The casuals you are appeasing will be gone when the next gimmicky trash comes along and we the real fans will be waiting as usual at the back of the queue.",

There's no shooting, no conflict and you are basically left to explore.\r And explore I did.  It's not a huge game, there's not that many rooms and not an endless amount to interact with.  But what is there gives the gamer a real sense of a family that 'something has occurred with' ...no spoilers here!\r With that, comes a real tenderness to the game.  Early on you hear a disturbing voice mail, with thunder constantly giving the gamer a sense of dread and isolation, the remains of everything you find feels as melancholic and once-meaningful.  There's an underlying heartache at the centre of the story that as it unravels, left a big impression on me.\r The voice acting, alike Firewatch, is excellent.  It feels unscripted and natural, like any old family.  This is such a huge part of the immersion of Gone Home.\r This game won't be for everyone.  I completed it in just over 2 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I think Firewatch is still the better game, as the character interaction / script is even better.  But the sense of dread, loss and melancholic bliss I got from Gone Home will sit with me for a long long while.\r Those people rating is ZERO just didn't read up on what the game was pre purchase, it is what it is, I don't buy NFL games and cry that it's not FIFA, read before you buy people!!!",

Now while i have only finished 7 visual novels with some on my backlog , however it doesn't change that fact that i really, really liked this game.\r The story/ plot was interesting all the way trough with alot of twist and turns i didn't see coming. While i have played alot of sad and emotinal  games during my time, this has to be one of the saddest or most emotional once, has at least a couple of scenes that really hit you or at least it hit me. I really liked the setting , that it takes place in modern Japan or a Japan from 2008 or so, despite it being 10 years old i think it has hold up pretty well.\r I really like all the varied characters you met or/ and you played as. They were more then varied enough, and how the all got intertwined with each other from time to time was really , really great. I liked the fact that you play as 5 different characters all with they own personality and the own reason to be a part of the story. I liked that you can jump back and forth between characters to unlock more parts of the story. I loved all the weird and funny bad endings , i think most if not all of those i have seen makes sense, but some are still pretty funny or weird. I really liked that the game had some humor, and had it share of funny moments.\r Also think the soundtrack is pretty damn good. Their might be some wrong typos, but not that many and it didn't affect the game for me, but well thats about the only negative thing i got.\r If you can play this game without to much hype, and you play a hr or two a day or so, you will get yourself a fantastic game that i argue deserves far more attention and that goes for the genre it self to, this is quickly becoming one of my all time favourite games if it isn't even that already. Excellent game with alot of humor and charm and if you just can accept that it takes place in 2008 or so ,you will get an excellent Visual novel. Recommended if you like that genre. PS: i am not to fond of the rating system, but i would consider this a masterpiece even tough that word is used to much especially if you can play it slow or just take you time to enjoy it and try to ignore the hype. I fell it has hold up very well.\r the review might be updated when i get all the bad endings or alternate endings.",

To start, there is a lot of gameplay variety and a whole lot to do. It seems often that you are playing multiple different games, yet each type of activity blends with the others seamlessly. The game is composed of three parts; a real-time arena type combat (similar to final fantasy 15), real-time army tactics (total war series), and a city building simulator (sim city). The goal of the game is to build a new kingdom and to have all the kingdoms of the world sign a peace treaty called the \"declaration of interdependence\". This journey will have you traveling throughout each kingdom and discovering new lands as you build your little town into a thriving kingdom. Of the three gameplay types, the real-time strategy is definitely the weakest. it is not by any means a negative, but it does stand out as being less engaging an activity. The art style and animation is what will stand out for most. It is very reminiscent of Ghibli films and their art style, Cartoony and simplistic, but endearing. The open world is for the most part an traditional RPG format with miniaturized character models who travel through areas with sparse roaming enemies who will trigger a combat scenario if encountered. The leveling system and combat mechanics are superb with many ways to master combat abilities to take on the toughest foes. Very rewarding. To mention some negatives, the game sometimes relies to heavily on reading character text rather than hearing the voice actors. It would have been nice to have that extra effort put in and experience more character acting. The story is fun but by no means the pinnacle of pristine story telling. Overall, there is a great time to be had with Ni No Kuni 2 for those fans of modern and traditional RPGs.",

The combat in the game is a very well done action RPG style that I thought was the best part of the game. However while the combat is extremely fun and engaging, the extremely cookie-cutter story is beyond boring and seemingly meant for a much younger audience. I kinda expected that but there were moments where it was almost agonizingly hard to get through. I found myself just skipping alot of the dialogue towards the end because I just really didn't care about what was going on. The main reason to keep playing was the kingdom building aspect of the game. It's how you get basically all of the upgrades throughout the game and gaining new citizens to build up your kingdom was the highlight for me. I wasn't impressed that EVERY side quest devolved into a fetch quest. There are so many fetch quests in this game it could probably have been added as a subtitle to the game. Nothing was too hard to come by, even though there are a few quests that are oddly misplaced in where they are available in the game. Meaning there are some that were designed for items you get in the end game they ask for early on and vice-versa. It seems like a bit of an oversight. The main thing I can say about this game is that at least the story was more bearable then the first game. It's not as kiddy as the first game was, but its still extremely boring at times because it was clearly made with a younger audience in mind. I could recommend this to anyone who's pre-teens might be wanting to get into a light JRPG style game. As the combat and kingdom building parts are actually very good. It's just hard to recommend to anyone over that age because that's not exactly this games target audience IMO.",

The puzzles had to be pitched at a level where they wouldn't be too frustrating for people of average intelligence, and I think anyone should bear this in mind when writing a review.  Also, do you really want to discourage other developers from creating such innovative experiences?\r The good:  Lovely Portal-like sense of humour.  Graphics and sound are very polished; puzzle design is original, and there's hardly any repetition.  Sense of immersion is total, one of the best for the PSVR, and it's the perfect game to show off your PSVR system to friends and family.  Variety and imagination of puzzles is also excellent, lots of \"woah\" moments.  No hints as to how to solve the puzzles; you just have to sit and think your way out of each situation.  All of the puzzles' solutions were extremely fair and came naturally, given a bit of time.\r The bad:  There's one puzzle in the set which relies on fast reaction times; I can see why they put it in (for variety, tension), but I didn't particularly enjoy it as much as the others.  It's a very clever puzzle, but just felt a bit out of place.\r I really can't think of any way in which this game could be improved; I really had to think hard to mention a single bad thing above.  Obviously, more content would be nice.  If this game is successful; perhaps the content to price ratio will improve.",

I loved the unique atmosphere this game had and it made you feel slightly uneasy even while being relaxed.  Overall, a very solid package.  One thing though that really got on my nerves was the hands attached to the box.  Very often, I had to fight with the controls, to make sure the box was facing the correct way.  Even when I adjusted the camera settings and turned off all the lights, I still had issues.  It made a great game become very annoying at times.",

I am not going to argue that the story is boring, the cutscenes are poorly done and so on. I do think that this is true, but many people seem to like it so I wouldn't focus on that very much. The biggest problem with this game is the combat and how poor the mechanics are. First of all you will go into each battle with little idea on whom to bring with you and as this is important you can find yourself in a bad situation and need to restart. You will get a B if you play well and try to enjoy yourself if you want an A make all scouts and storm the enemy camp. So let me ask you, does that seem like a good mechanic to you were most of the time most of your soldiers are useless? Also, actually attacking is a disadvantage as enemies can shoot you endlessly while you approach, hence killing you and this is automatic and happens all the time (unless you flank). Also, it says they stop firing at you as soon as you aim, but no they can still get a few many shots in before the system kicks in also helping in the killing you part. Hiding behind cover is overpowered for enemies, as what was killing an enemy after 2 hits now becomes 20 hits so good luck and basically no unit can kill them in one go (so they will return fire). I have just started this nothing yet and I assume you can see that the strategy part of this game is messed so I'll summarize:\r- all but scouts and engineers move a very shot running distance making it a pain to move them.\r- as a result you will find having only half you team doing something as you can select the same person multiple times (run multiple times).\r- enemies can appear in the story parts in which you have no chance of defending (not letting anyone die) unless you knew of this before hand.\r- You get significantly less turns than the enemy making it feel unfair in many battles.\r- too be honest the difficulty is not that high (pretty easy) you just need to replay almost each encounter twice if you want good results.\r- most classes feel pointless based on type of battle.\r- no real progression, no new weapons/armor unless you do something special and upgrades are not that good.\r- Need to memorize who likes who and what their stupid weaknesses and strengths are (you need to memorize this in before battle cuz you wont see it during the battle).\r- Can't tell who are leaders in your party unless you are already in battle (gives extra moves).\r- if you liked xcom like me, just know this is nothing a like that, the strategy part here is almost none existent. All you need is the knowledge of how the enemy will move as they are very predictable after they use their cheap trick, which you cannot defend against at first.\r DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!",

Forget the rest and pick career mode. This is where like all the critics have raved about the biggest improvements on last years. And let me say this, you will want to play all 3 practice sessions ok. Let me explain. You are given little challenges to complete and in the process get yourself up the leaderboard and get that number one spot. Then qualifying, oh wow it’s a one shot one lap shootout, but the great thing is the lead car is a ghost, say it could be Vettel or Hamilton, or anyone for that matter, beat the ghost car in one lap you've bagged pole position. And just to note for those new to this, well there isn’t many of us new to it when it comes watching this great sport but playing it is a very different animal.

However it's the VR implementation that really shines for me - never before have I felt so in-touch with a VR world - subtle use of the controller vibration and some clever tricks really gave objects in the world a tactile sensation. I spent about 5 minutes just lifting up a dumbbell and a pot-plant trying to work out what the game was doing that made one of them \"feel\" heavier than the other. Outstanding. A little spooky in places but doesn't resort to any cheap jump-scares. Give it a go, you wont be disappointed.",

The overall map is small, the quests are repetitive, the story is as almost as absent as Destiny's, and the camera is faulty. The nemesis system is what stands out the most in defining what makes this game unique. In that, the AI is smart in the long term but stupid in the short term. There is little variety in the game. Almost every enemy is Orc, again and again and again. I guess they can excuse the masses of dumb AI Orcs because masses of Orcs are dumb- so that was by design right? Right... And as with the gameplay so the same with the environment, it's a small open world and it all looks the same. When I think of LOTR, I think of grand beautiful variations of environments, races, and adventures. I mean I've only seen one hobbit and one elf; no wizards, dwarves, or trolls. This is just one small shadow of mordor. Still... The game is good. The challenges themselves are challenging and fun. The action is exciting. The graphical detail of Talion and each Orc is all very well done. It is similar to Arkham and AC as so may have said, which is not a bad thing. I'd also say that it's similar to Infamous as well in the layout of the map, quest & ability progression, and use of cutscenes. Music and voice acting are very good. It's got a solid dozen hours of fun. I just feel like it could/should be so much more.",

What i was disappointed most was the open world, it can't be even named an open world because it's actually one big Orcish fortress. There are no places to explore, not a very good environment, no mountains to climb, no beautiful outlooks on missing mountains. You are going to have to get used on these PS4 controlls and it can be very annoying from the beginning. People say that the combat is very fun. I don't understand them. I don't see this as fun to spam square and when the triangle appears overhead of an enemy you press triangle. I don't know what is so much fun on that. However i can't imagine it differently so I'm not descreasing rating on this game because of combat. There are also some skills those you can use when you get further in game and you can have fun with them. Overally only 6/10 game. I Wouldn't buy it if I would know it's gonna be like this. But if you are very big fan of LOTR you may like this and not agree with my review.",

The input lag is not bad probably about 3-4 frames which is average. Online has a legit lobby system where you can customize your avatiar. There are numerous colors for each character.

                "review": "[Introduction]\r The game is really good and every time arc system works releases a new BlazBlue title they improve the menu, the game modes, the gameplay and so on. From the japan arcades the game arrived to the console versions, but it will be different from the other versions ? Let's talk about the different modes.\r [Story Mode]\r The story mode is really original, you will play with the characters while they talk or fight each other with a stage in the background in true anime style. You can play the main events or if you want go into the deep you can watch the subs, they help you to understand some parts that are not very clear. Also there are the gags, these parts are simply moments of fun between the characters, to entertain the player a little bit longer. Each gag has a duration around 30 minutes. To complete the entire mode you need to play at least 20 hours.\r [Arcade Mode]\r The Blazblue Central Fiction arcade mode is different from the other Blazblue titles. It is divided in three parts, once the character is selected you will be sent to the story parts that you can play. Some fighters can be use in all parts others not. To complete an arcade mode you must defeat eight characters.\r [Network Mode]\r The online mode has a lobby system where you can customize your avatar and your room to play against other players. A room can contain up to eight players.\r [Other Single Player Modes]\r - Grim of abyss mode: through the help of a grimoire, which is used to make your character stronger, you have to clear the dungeons. The difficulty goes from easy to hard, also there is a boss mode, you must defeat a particular number of bosses to go on with mode.\r - Score attack mode: choose your course and fight against the computers with regulated settings and compete for the highest score. Scores will be logged in the rankings.\r - Speed star mode: defeat enemies that appear one after another. Time will be added if you deal high damage or finish with special move.\r [Practice mode]\r Are you new to the Blazblue series or fighting games ? Don't worry, this mode will help you to understand the basic mechanics, also there is a tutorial for each single character to help you understand the mechanics as well.\rThis game has a really good challenge mode where you must complete 20 missions set for each character, and the missions will increase difficulty as long as you go on.\r [Collection Mode]\r In this mode you will replay the match videos, the story videos, you can also buy illustrations, soundtracks and characters colours. To buy these items you need the P$ value, which is obtainable by playing the game.\r [Roster]\r The Blazblue Central Fiction roster is really big with 35 playable characters, each one has 24 colours variations.\r [Soundtrack]\r The soundtrack is awesome, every song is mixed with rock and epic music style.\r [Gameplay]\r The gameplay is not really different from the other Blazblue, however the characters are balanced and they have unique styles. The combat system is based on four buttons ABCD, if you press ABCD at the same time you wil activate the overdrive mode. it is used to power up your character special moves, also if you press the four buttons simultaneously you will unleash a powerful attack.\r [Graphic]\r The characters sprites have the same art style, but the stages have a better graphics and the old ones got a restyle.\r [Conclusion]\r\r\nBlazblue Central Fiction is a great game, with a long story and different single player modes, you will spend a lot of your free time. Unfortunately the network mode is the same and there isn't an english dub, which was really great in the previous titles.\r\nIf you are Blazblue fans you must buy this game and add it into your collection.",

                "review": "Cuando escucho “Arc System Works” serán los responsables de una nueva entrega de juegos de lucha, solo puedo emocionarme al imaginarme el divertido sistema y mecánicas que traerán con su entrega.\r Desde la primera vez que supe que Arc System desarrollaría una nueva IP después de Guilty Gear -juego el cual me encanto cuando lo pude disfrutar en DS, y Xbox- no podía esperar menos que peleas frenéticas y llamativas, personajes alocados acompañados con una grandiosa banda sonora de guitarra haciendo que cada pelea se sienta memorable.\r Así fue como dio inicio una de mis franquicias favoritas de todos los tiempos, BLAZBLUE Calamity Trigger tenia todo lo que podía pedir en un juego de lucha, un roster de personajes atractivos y llamativos -pocos en comparación a los que presento SFIV o MvC3 a su inicio- una banda sonora increíble y un modo historia que trataba de mostrarte el universo que se creo solo para ese juego.\r blazblue_centralfiction_artwork\r Central Fiction es la ultima entrega y el final de esta historia, en palabras del creador Toshimichi Mori, el quiso entregar todo de si en esta entrega para poder concentrarse en un juego diferente, de otro genero aunque sin dejar de apoyar el balance de esta entrega con parches.\r Tras haber finalizado casi en un 90% la historia, creo que el final no podrá abarcar todo lo que me hubiera gustado ver, siento algo de tristeza el saber que termino algo que comenzó hace casi 9 años, y a su vez, siento alegría al saber que tengo en mis manos el desenlace de uno de mis juegos favoritos de todos los tiempos.\r Aunque a muchos dicen que “un modo historia viene de más en un juego de lucha”, Blazblue es de los primeros que trata de crear una Novela Visual con su juego, al final, el modo historia viene rondando entre las 20 a 25 hrs, y que estoy seguro que no muchos seran capaces de terminar, a algunos se les hará cansado porque realmente, es como leer una novela ligera.  Pero para todos ellos, existe el ya clásico y en algunas franquicias olvidado, modo ARCADE, el cual esta dividido en 3 actos en algunos personajes, dándonos una visión más completa de lo que ocurre y como concluye esta historia.\r centralfiction_character_select_screen\r Entrando en modo de juego, que es lo que realmente importa, cada personaje a sido balanceado, contando con un total de 35 personajes a elegir, uno de ellos desbloqueable y dos que forman parte del DLC -Si lo conseguiste la primer semana, podías conseguir a ES de forma gratuita- dando mucha variedad a los gustos de todos. Y desde usuarios hardcore hasta casuales pueden disfrutar del juego gracias a su modalidad STYLISH y TECHNICAL, donde uno te facilita la acción de combos espectaculares y en el otro, dependes completamente de tu habilidad para poder lograr el mayor daño posible.\r blazbluecentralfictionizanaminine_thumb blazblue-central-fiction-aug2016-screenshot7\rblazblue_central_fiction_2\rEl modo online sigue funcionando de forma correcta, hasta la fecha, yo no he sufrido de lag durante el combate, solo una pequeña bajón de frames en la introducción del combate y es todo, me encanto que las partidas RANKED sean tan sencillas de encontrar -aunque cuando te topas con el que barrio el suelo con tu Noel no ten den ganas de ponerlo tan seguido- y que en los lobbys, a diferencia de Guilty Gear, sean mucho más  limpios para encontrar jugadores u organizar tu propio combate con tus amigos.\r Y si no cuentas con suscripción PLUS, no tienes por que preocuparte, Central Fiction cuenta con alrededor de 7 modos de juego donde podrás poner a prueba toda tu habilidad, incluyendo un modo tutorial para aprender las bases asi como una serie de desafíos para que domines los mejores combos y cadenas de tu personaje favorito.\r También, cuenta con un basto modo galería y una tienda de objetos desbloqueables para el modo online o patrones de color para tus personajes, podrías vaciarte horas tratando de desbloquearlos y ver los maravillosos trabajos que componen el arte de Central Fiction.\r Algo que me gusto que quitaran, fueron las explicaciones de la sección de Miss Litchi, que en su mayoría era contenido repetido de otros juegos, en cambio, dieron una completa sección llamada Librería, donde hacen la explicación de cada personaje, arma, termino y ciudad del juego, siendo un mejor y más fácil compendio para conocer más de la historia, mundo y personajes.\r 396219-bb2\r Algo que extraño, aunque no todos estarán de acuerdo, son las voces en ingles, realmente disfrutaba yo de escuchar a estos personajes con esa traducción, pero por decisiones directivas, se escogió sacar el juego un mes después que en Japón para ahorrarse el doblaje.",

                "review": "I don't HATE the game but it's lacking in several areas and this is coming from a MAJOR Blazblue fan. So Graphics are what you would expect from Blazblue plus some nice lil Anime \"Movies\" so that's good\r Gameplay however...well here's my problem. In The first one you could use the right stick to pull off special moves. The second introduced a \"Stylish\" system which was for helping new players be it new to Blazblue or to fighting games at all this was good too however it heavily favored technical users as it was so easy for an online player to counter this system and set the styleish player up for an easy win. Being a Technical myself I got plenty of wins off this but I'm not one to favor one sided fights even if I am the winner. Then came the third where they improved both. Technical's like me had a few moves that the styleish ones wouldn't use as the button mashing didn't include them. Stylish users had more moves in their button mashing and could use any special with ease. This wasn't always a good thing either as some combos lead into a distortion (Super move) when you didn't want to do this which encouraged players to learn the combos for a character see them with styleish and such then pushed them to go to technical Combo examples is what they were which helped them go \"Ok well this is good but I bet I could improve on this by doing it like-\" So it helped BOTH sides have fun. However while the combo assisting is still there the whole arsenal isn't. The new system allows pushing of the R2 button to do special attacks instantly in an effort to push players into Technical they dumbed down the damage.\r Now...this isn't the worst thing ever. My main problem is how they seemed to just release the game then tell their entire fan base they don't matter. No reply to a 5K plus petition and speaking out of their own voice actors for no english dubbing. But this isn't the worst part here's what is their own Terms of Service are REALLY simplified. Not a ton of legal terms however one is forced to click \"Agreed\" about 8 times for 8 different things you agree to (Not cheating, not harassing, not threating, not causing mental stress, it goes on and on.) All of which finish with the \"If you are caught your account will be suspended.\" Meaning no online play. This isn't held up at all. I got not being able to monitor thousands of games at a time, that's a given. However the forms...If I were to sit down I could monitor that easily as they're not done by threads rather simple posting with no comments. Upon entering A LOT of the very things you're forced to agree upon are being reported. Nothing is done. Now...it can be said for any game that no one reads the terms of service. They click \"I have read and agree to the rules.\" Then move on to play. This is true for most, however they are there it's like the laws you only need to know and abide by the basics of the basics yet you could get through life fine.\r Story: Hard as hell to spoil anything cause Blazblue's story is one of the most insanely complex stories ever. But...it's bad. For the first two games you were given a story from each character's propective which had three endings (True, bad and gag.) The third was more straightforward three stories One for the six heroes, one for the main cast and one Sector Seven. The timeline was shown and it was easier to understand even for newcomers to the series it helped them get into it. (A good friend of mine jumped in on the third game and was able to get it despite it still being confusing.) while once again here it's still confusing it's even more so than ever. As with the third game it lacks actual gameplay and is more like watching a movie without all the movement. Fixed poses and such even more so than before, now. This is where The English Cast came in they put the emotion into the dialog. It felt like you wanted to hear them say it not just read it and skip ahead to the next dialog line before they finished talking. Also several things that are included in the games codex yet were never really a thing in the games themselves are just NOW being noticed? You've had them in gameplay but story only sees them now?  Whats worse is how much is \"Lost\" BB has unique interactions with characters who have a history which is nearly everyone with everyone. Not subbing a fight I get (That's distracting) Not subbing intro's? That's bad especially for a climax here. Yes this is the final game in the series why drop GOOD voice actors now?\r Despite all this gameplay is fun. It has characters that are all unique and play VERY differently. Moreso than most fighters. The game even helps you learn how to play characters in a tutorial on them. Teaching you A LOT more than any fighter I've played. Music is good too. Online play isn't that good though as I have good internet speed and the input lag is BAD. While you can't do anything about actual players (They are who they are.)

I also don't appreciate the home screen trying to sell me crap - I just want to play the game!\r One thing that stood out in the game was that the graphics can be so great but the framerate absolutely dreadful at times. I usually have to focus very hard to see framerate issues but the stuttering and jagged-edges of Hitman is very noticeable and very frequent. Still, it doesn't ruin the experience.\r Like all Hitman games, the gameplay is where it stands out. The sandbox you are dropped into each level is amazing. It can be fun to explore and familiarise yourself with your settings before finding the assassination method that suits you best. Quite often I stumbled onto methods serendipituously, but that's part of the experience.\r What did grind my gears a lot were the slow menus when I paused the game. It took far too long to save my game and then even longer when I wanted to reload a save after screwing something up. I hope they fix this in the sequel, which I may buy soon.\r Overall, a decent game but they screwed up in a few places.

Rave reviews and Dark Souls comparisons were all it took to make me take the plunge into the eerily beautiful world Ska Studios created. Within the first hour, S+S felt strikingly familiar to Dark Souls in terms of game mechanics (souls vs. salt, interconnected world design, risk vs. reward scenarios, etc). While tough at first, the learning curve definitely levels off less than halfway through the game, which was a bit disappointing given the punishing nature of the first couple areas. Along with poor end-game balancing, I found that gold became virtually meaningless at around the same point in the story. These were really the only two issues I had with the game. Enemy design was creative, areas were unique but connected, combat was fluid without bugs. All in all, S+S comes together to create a unique, yet familiar universe for hardcore-RPG fans everywhere.",

I didn't want to change the parts where I was mistaken so you could see how impression can change during time spent with the game and how easy it is to stick a 'dark souls clone' label on it.)\r It is impossible to write about this game without mentioning Dark Souls because this is basically Dark Souls in 2D platform style. I am a veteran of all Souls games but I never played much platform games and I probably suck at these. For this reason I was afraid I might not like S&S as much as I would like to.\r However the way this game works and feels is much more Dark Souls than just a platform game. Apparently the creators played Souls games a lot and carefully observed its mechanics: reward structure, learning curve, boss fights... S&S also gives you everything Soul series is known for: challenge, difficulty, many builds to toy with, huge adrenaline spikes, grim but also melancholic mood...As a Dark Souls fan I couldn't ask for more. And it was made by a team of two people! (plus two cats). S&S also borrows some unique ideas from other games, like huge skill tree reminding me so much of Path Of Exile.\r It's easy to treat this game as an appetizer before the main course which is Dark Souls 3 coming up in april but fortunately this game's replay value is high, with multiple unique weapons and play styles. I already see myself coming back to it even after DkS3 is out.\r If I was forced to find a flaw in this game it would be probably the fact that it sometimes follows DkS too closely in terms of some designs. Like huge golems with shields and spears reminding me so much of these in Anor Londo, even having same move set. But it's hardly a problem, especially for a game that is a homage to Dark Souls anyway.\r I don't give 10/10 to games because even in the most refined product there is always something that could be made better. Perfection doesn't exist, one can get only very close to it. So 9/10 it is!\r EDIT:\r The above early review was based on 8 hours of gameplay. But after playing a lot more I have to admit how much mistaken I was. The game initially seemed like Dark Souls 2D but it is A LOT MORE. S&S has its own identity and the more you play the more interesting mechanisms you discover, especially in forms of new abilities given to your character (brands). They make moving around, discovering and fighting even more interesting. They also give you an access to areas previously unreachable so you may want to revisit old places in search for some tasty goodies. For reasons above not only Dark Souls fans should give it a try but also every fan of platform games because these elements too are very well designed. The game combines what is best both in platform games and Souls games, creating fresh and unique experience.\r And the price tag - for the amount of fun and possible playthroughs this game provides the price is a steal. Don't miss it.",

Then get Dark Souls because what have you been doing with your life?\r This game is basically 2D dark souls. Removing that third dimension changes the game-play quite drastically as it plays like a platformer and therefore combat has far more verticality to it . The fights are far less methodical and much faster. S&S does make you realise how much dark souls cribbed from Castlevania as it plays very much like SOTN. I would go as far as saying that this game is best Metroidvania game in years.\r The game is far less punishing at the beginning and much easier to get into due to the inherent familiarity of plat-formers that allot of gamers have. Though the game is not easy and going rashly into a fight with new enemies will kill you rather quickly. It does steal allot of elements from the dark souls universe (estus flask, bonfires, covenants, souls, parrying, etc) meaning that if you've played a souls game before it will seem quite familiar, if you haven't its a great way to learn how the world of souls works.It is essentially the best dark souls tutorial you can get without playing dark souls as it is less punishing initially and can get you used to the mechanics of the game with much more ease.\r For veteran souls players there is still allot to see. The lore, style and aesthetic is very different. There are built-in challenge modes such as: perma-death, no healing and naked. When \"hall of champions\" mode is turned on everything moves faster, bosses start in their 2nd phase, the AI is smarter and enemies have better stats. In other words this game can be incredibly difficult if you want it to be. Therefore the game is therefore perfect for newcomers and veterans alike to tide you over for DS3.\r My one complaint about the game is that there is not much freedom to mix and match how your character plays midway through the game. In dark souls sure you pick your class, but you can still try out different play styles to some degree for about the first 20% of the game as it is your stats that determine which weapons you can use. Here weapons are handed out at a really stingy rate and weapons are based on skills not stats meaning you are locked into certain weapon groups and if you don't realise quick enough you might have to do a fairly large grinding session to level up to get the skills required. Not to mention weapons are handed out at really stingy rates. So for example if you try and specialise in archery early on in the game, there is one bow that is at your disposal for a significant portion of the game. However specialising in heavy armour, swords and shields works much better. I'd say at the start of the game is a little unbalanced though not a reason to miss out. If you play through once you will be able to build your character accordingly\r In summary, if you like dark souls and looking for something to quench your souls based thirst, give it a go.The game has enough of its own style to hold its own. If you are a fan of the 2D castlevania/metroid games give this a shot it is the best 2D metroidvania since the GBA days. If you have been curious about playing souls, this is a little taster that will get you the idea. This game isn't as perfect as dark souls but would definitely give it a go.",

It was a massive disappointment, The graphics were barely updated, 60 fps is good but not a big enough change for me to care other than blighttown no longer being negative three fps that was good, however the game didn't change enough for me to be to interested in doing everything again it was just so over hyped and not really worth the price tag at all, it's original intended audience was newer players to the franchise whether they started on Bloodborne or DS3/DS2 and of course the veterans that wanted to experience this amazing game again, but it turned out that it was more tuned to players who are new to the series who never experienced the better gameplay and in general game compared to the others (especially Dark Souls 2) I finished this game and noticed something not sure whether it was because before I got Dark Souls Remastered it had been awhile since I played Dark Souls but common enemies seem harder to deal with now but the bosses seem so much easier, seriously I'll run down how many deaths I had to each boss (yes I counted)\rGargoyles: 2 Deaths, Quelaag: 0 deaths, Capra Demon: 0 Deaths, Taurus Demon: 0 deaths, Iron golem: 0 deaths, O&S: 2 deaths, Four Kings: 1 death, Nito: 0 deaths, BoC: 0 deaths, Seath: 1 death (not including purposeful death), Sanctuary Guardian: 0 deaths, Artorias: 2 deaths, Manus: 0 deaths, Kalameet: 1 death (not including Purposeful death), Priscilla: 0 deaths and to finish it off Gwyn: 1 death...

Clunky combat, spamming backstabs, and poorly \"remastered textures\" that look like a copy paste of 2012 without polishing all of the above stated makes me feel like I just flushed $40 down the abyss with Artorious and the rest. I know people see Demons Souls as the unpolished \"Deer Hunter\" to the Dark Souls \"Silence of the Lambs\" but lets be honest, the Soulsborne archetype gets gud with Bloodborne, when we all aren't hiding behind our shields and spamming and cheating a game that will cheat you with cheap deaths, when combat is fluid and exhilarating and defeating bosses feels rewarding rather than just a feeling of relief to be done with it all.",

Очень надеюсь, что многие проблемы исправят с патчами, но саму игру это вряд ли исправит - слишком много переделывать придется.\r Возвращаюсь к первой части, которую хочется переигрывать снова и снова, а это игра на 1 прохождение.

SoulCalibur VI offers custom character creation, a nice variety of game modes including CPU vs CPU, good music, and the game runs great. The character creation is in depth and offer lots of different ways to customize and create your characters. There is also in-game currency for buying equipment in character creation, I really like this.

It feels responsive and it is easy to get into with a dept there that will be fun to explore.\rThe character customization is good, would have likes some more pieces of cloths but all in all it is better then Tekken 7 in this department.\rThe Libra of souls has this far been way more fun then I thought it would be.\r Hit or miss\rThe visuals can be good or bad depending if you like the art-style or not, personally I do like it but I can see some people not liking it.\r The bad.\rThe way in which the story is presented feels cheap, Don't get me wrong here, I do enjoy stories told to still pictures as well, just that they could have had more pictures while showing the story. Often you are shown the same old picture with a picture of a character and some enemy. This is the weakest part of the game.\rThe day one dlc. The character in that dlc fits better into the story then some of the character in the base roster. This easily avoided PR mess up is something they need to learn from\r I get the feeling that Namco gave the devs very little money for this project, and as such they needed to focus on some things, thankfully they focused on the right thing.

                "review": "Soulcalibur 6 – Summary: Too flashy & gimmicky. Nowhere near as well refined, clean, balanced, or well produced as Soul Calibur 2 or 3. Control issues, tedious menu navigation, glitchy & dull customization, long loading times.\r Critical Problems that need immediate fixing:\r-Control Customization - Fix Needed: Allow mapping of a single button (A/B/K/G) to more than 1 button on the controller. For example, allow “G” to be mapped to both “Left Trigger” AND the “A” button on an Xbox controller. (This was possible on Sega Dreamcast & Xbox for Soul Calibur 1,2,3 etc). Not having this available is crippling!\r-Graphics Options Needed: Please make a setting to reduce or remove the special effects from some or all attacks. They are far too bright and shiny, and they make it extremely difficult to see what is happening. I would much rather see the location of my weapon and the stance of my foe than a bunch of fake lights & colors. I understand why unblockable attacks have flames and special effects, but every single attack glowing and zapping is just too much. It also makes it harder to tell “special” attacks from “normal” attacks. This option would also be very beneficial for epileptic players.\r Expanded Review: The game has been dumbed down and is clearly intended to be “noob fancy.” A new player can smash a lot of buttons, make crazy flames and lightning shoot out of their blade, and have their character do wacky flips and spins that may even harm their opponent. However, this actually deteriorates the overall play quality, as actually figuring out what is going on is nearly impossible. The “reversal edge” mechanic just slows down gameplay with a fancy slo-mo sequence, but punishes players who actually know moves and combos by trapping them in a “rock-paper-scissor” scenario. The same is true for the “soul charge” attacks, which are flashy yet pointless.\r-Just because something is bright and colorful or “cool looking” does not mean it is good for gameplay.\r Other Problems:\r-Clipping, Clothing, & Materials: For some reason, clothing was not designed properly. Nearly every piece of clothing clips through other clothing. Pants cut through boots, shirts can be seen through belts and waistbands.\rAdditionally, clothing does NOT fit the character. Belts and bandoliers hover about 2-3 inches off the body of the character, as if there is some anti-gravitation field around you. Shoulder pads seem to float magically upon you as well. Just about every regular piece of clothing (except the “sexy lady clothes”) is bulky & enormous. Even the plain white t-shirt seems to be made of cloth that is about 3 inches thick. Even the basic skirt makes your character’s hips look about 4 feet wide and chunky.\rThere is also a surprisingly small amount of custom clothing available. This, combined with the fact that almost every piece of non-bondage clothing makes your character look like a fat oaf, makes the actual outfit choice and character customization quite limited and dull.\r-Soul Calibur 3 and 4 had excellent customization with many items, weapons, and much less clipping. If they could do it on PS2 and Xbox, they should be able to do it now.\rCharacter Customization – Fix Needed: You should be able to preview changes on the actual model before selecting the item; hovering over the item should apply it to your model as a preview.\rMenu & Story Navigation is Tedious & Bothersome: Story mode takes ages to navigate through page after page of single lines of text. Either introduce a “Skip” button, or put all of this information on 1-2 pages that we can read if we feel like it. Pressing a button 13 times just to get to the next fight is tedious and boring.\rNavigating through menus requires too much button pressing. Simple arrow keys work in most every other game. Almost everything in this game requires an arrow press, then “select,” then another arrow press, then “select.”",

I wanted to like this one because I had good memories of Soul Calibur 6 but man oh man did this one disappoint.\r Wanna see everybody spam rock-paper-scissors QTEs repeatedly ad infinitum?  Wanna see the same characters of Groh and Nightmare over and over again in matches?  Wanna see the flow of combat grind to a complete halt everytime someone does a \"flashy\" move and everything stops so it can look like a movie?  The base mechanics itself are okayish (but not balanced) but instead of making it better they just tacked on a bunch of \"bling\" to make it look good but really bring down the gameplay.\r The main story mode is laughable and is only a retread of the original Soul Calibur.  Sorry, but in the age of Injustice, Smash, and Guilty Gear, half-assed doesn't cut it anymore.  Like really?  Texts and terrible artwork for the majority of your cutscenes?  And the main plot was Zzzzzzzzz boring with repeated cheesy but not funny lines and it barely incorporates the cast.  Sure there's \"side stories\" but those were pretty mediocre as well.  Why have us fighting mooks that don't even appear in the game?  This is a fighting game, your plot should have reason for these characters to meet and duke it out more.\r You'd think that character creation and the \"Libra of Souls\" mode would pick up alot of the slack here, but it doesn't.  Don't get me wrong, it's fun to create and mess around with custom characters, but the mode that goes along with it is just boring.  Everything again here is told through texts and portraits and you only get the meager offering of freedom with a good/evil character choice system and \"exploration\" that you have to pay money to even go to side missions.  Just be sure to do that when the main campaign's path is near them because you can get ambushed by significantly higher leveled AI that will waste your money if you lose.\r All in all, SC6 is a let down and in this hypercompetitive fighting game market, you can do far better.",

However what you get with Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is an unprecedented freedom and a great sense of reward and achievement.

It's not without it's faults, some suspect lip syncing, dodgy character models and too many bugs/glitches (some often game breaking). Some would argue that the end comes far too soon and is far to abrupt just as the story starts getting tasty, although I feel it does lead well to potentially (and surely) a third installment of Adam Jensen's cyberpunk conspiracy ridden saga. The ending is left opened for another Deus Ex and a sense of an uncertain future. Despite some of it's flaws, the overall open world of Prague and different approachs to each mission along with the vast exploration and engaging storyline make this an essential purchase who like a bit more than your average shooter.

I know the Deus Ex franchise, and I`ve played the original Deus Ex, as well as for the previous game in this series the Human Revolution. I`ve beaten this game two times already, INCLUDING the hardest difficulty, with the two styles of gameplay (the Rambo and the Stealth styles), so here are my thoughts for you. I`ll list all, so you can decide.\r The Cons:\r - This game is not balanced between the two styles of gameplay. If you play the Stealth you will get around 110% more XP reward for everything you do, and most Jensen`s Augmentations (including the new ones) are way more biased toward Stealth. Thus, if you like to shoot your way into missions, be prepared to get fewer rewards.\r-  There is too much Hack in this game. Hacking was always a thing for Deus Ex, since the first, but this game overdue the amount of Hack. You can easily find codes around, and new entrances to bypass but are just a lot of hacking.\r- I didn`t find the story as compelling in this game that it was on Human Revolution. I`m not even comparing to the original, because the original is the best.\r- I get that Augmented people are hated now, because of the incident from the last game, but is just too much. Around 80% of people you talk are complete a**ho***. Like. Every. People. You. Talk. This discourages you to talk to NPCs because you just had enough of rude people.\r- Breach. This is a parallel game mechanics, not related to the main game. HERE, is where they inserted the microtransaction. Breach is just disgusting. Its ugly is not fun, is annoying, has no glory at all. Its just some c**p they inserted to choke coins out of you. I can even begin to explain how dreadful this is. And this c**p has 4 trophies for the Platinum. Argh.\r The Good:\r - Like the previous, the combat is great.\r- Jensen`s new Augmentations are neat. Really, they are neat.\r- There are tons of ways to do a mission, so this game gets a 10 in this. You can completely choose your way. Dozens of ways to get around in both Stealth and Combat. Thus, you will enjoy exploring this world.\r- Here is the best part of this game (for me): The Sidequests. These sidequests are masterpieces. They are UNIQUE, INTERESTING, EMOTIONAL. Really, this is the best part, do all of them.\r- The graphics are awesome, the texture is well made.\r- The major NPCs have interesting personalities and the Social Aug has some utility now, in contrast to the previous entry in the game.\r I recommend you play the game, because its good. But you will face some problems. Breach is a pathetic excuse of parallel mechanics, stay away, but the main game is pretty good. The only problem is the unbalanced reward system for Rambo and Stealth players in terms of gameplay. And the lack of deep story, because this time it feels too shallow about 70% of the game. Nevertheless, it's not bad game, is stil really enjoyable for the good mechanics and fun missions.",

Its combination of simple and intuitive controls, excellent visual and auditory feedback, and compelling depth in movement mechanics and player strategies break new ground in the rhythm game genre. It is a difficult game to master on its own, a general understanding of rhythm is often what is needed to finish later levels (of which there are 9). Though this seems daunting,  levels are broken up in such a way that practicing and improving is as simple as playing them over and over. Though many rhythm games function like this, Thumper is different in that it asks you to memorize short rhythm sequences that are then later arranged into more complex patterns as opposed to entire songs. This makes the process of learning each level very streamlined and enjoyable because you begin to develop a feel for a set of rhythms and don't have to hold entire songs in memory. In VR, the game's visuals are incredible: an abstract, nightmarish glide through an infinite hell scape. They are so good that they often become a problem because you're not focusing on the track. Though it will likely be difficult and frustrating for those not accustomed to grind intensive, challenging game play, Thumper is a quintessential rhythm game for anyone interested in the genre, or in having an amazing VR experience.",

                "review": "Axiom Verge was a treat to play and with almost 30 hours invested into it I still have more weapons, areas and unlockables to uncover. The game from the beginning has a very noticeable Metroid meets Contra in the belly of Red Falcon sort of feel and I have to say that I love it. One thing right off the bat that this game gets right is the basic controls. Firing your weapon in all directions felt just as smooth as an NES or SNES side scrollers without that weightiness present in most games. Jumping and firing on enemies with the sound effects and enemy explosions felt satisfying. A very easy game to pick up and immediately start playing.\r The story is best described as a complex science fiction tale where a scientist named Trace supposedly dies in a lab explosion only to awaken unharmed in an alien world. Armed with a biomechanical gun and tasked by a female voice in his mind, Trace runs out into this mysterious world searching for answers while trying not get killed in the process.\r The game is filled with weapons, health and weapons upgrades, unique enemies, boss battles and of course secret areas. Each world is interconnected by portals or breaches in structures where you must fight enemies and find that specific upgrade to continue on.\r One of my favorite upgrades might have to be the mechanical drone. This little laser armed critter can get to hard to reach areas or tunnels all the while Trace is protected under a barrier shield. A very useful way to clear the path of enemies in tight situations. A later upgrade even allows you to increase the launch distance of the drone as well as allow you to teleport to its location making traversing areas quicker. The laser drill attachment also acquired near the begin is also a beautiful tool for passing through rocky areas and enemies.\r The music feels like a love letter to the chiptune styles of the NES and SNES and do I love the design choice.  The constant loop does bring back nostalgic feelings, however, I feel the sound was spot on for the atmosphere and style of the game.\r Of course, what appears to be pretty straight forward good vs evil side scrolling shooter evolves into an existential drama of dark events and discovery of who you really are – as well as the motives of your enemy and allies.  It is certainly complex and will get you pondering afterwards – however, there are quite a few hidden documents and notes that you can uncover and translate to find out what has been transpiring. I will not lie that some of it can be confusing, however, its complexity and winding nature kept me piqued. Whether a gamer loves it or hates it will be one’s story telling preferences methinks.\r If there were any issues, I would say that the dashing teleporting mechanic which later serves as a quick dash to break through walls or access alternate paths or double jump can be a little hard to master when trying to access overhead areas. I found it was best used in tandem with a grappling hook accessory.  In addition, the weapon wheel used to select your full arsenal in game vs. during a pause can be a little difficult to direct especially as you gain more weapons  – however, none of these were deal breakers.\r Also, anyone looking for someone to hold your hand, this is most likely not the game for you. Although you get save points in each map, there is no regenerative health (you have to earn it) and only one life.  There are no glowing indicators telling you exactly where to go (although colors exist on the map for potentially red boss rooms, light blue save rooms, or areas of importance) and you cannot teleport between worlds. You have to trek it out on foot or with your upgrades.  However, there are some hidden drops and one fast mode of travel in a specific area if a gamer discovers it. In addition, sometimes you will get trapped in a world with no option other than to go deeper into it. To me, it is my favorite environmental choice – forcing you to explore the rich environments, only to find another powerup to access other areas as well as allow you to finally backtrack to the previous worlds.\r As for the supposed “glitches” that appear on screen (another throwback to the NES days), these are actually intentional. A later upgrade called the Address Disruptor allows you to manipulate not only these glitchy environments to open up new areas but also change the attack patterns and forms of your enemies - sometimes even allowing them to spawn energy to refill your health.\r All of this (the game, soundtrack and story) developed by one man over a span of 5 years is astonishing in my opinion and shows how an indie game or any game can be done well with a great attention to detail and love for the genre. I only think what Tom Happ could do with a large team and bigger budget. If you have a PS4, I think it is a no brainer to get it, just be aware of what you are getting into.",

Controls are clunky (shouldve been twin stick shooting option), map is horrible (no zoom, no waypoints, no treasure indicator), no dashing/running and no warp rooms makes travel incredibly painful and slow. Music is a boring and repetitive mix between chiptune, ambient, and weird middle eastern \"allu akbar\" type vocals, thankfully I have Spotify. Theres a lot of weapons, however none of them are chargeable and most are useless. The tool upgrades are pretty bad too (no double jump but instead an awkward short teleport thing keyed to the control stick, no space jump even though theres a \"space jump\" upgrade that increases height by 1 pixel.) The boss battles are very boring and can either be hamrushed or cheap shotted very quickly, and the later battles can be skipped altogether, being rewarded for laziness with secret trophies. The plot is terrible and is told mainly through hidden notes (most of which need to be translated). The glitches are pretty bad even after several patches, and Ive also had issues getting certain trophies to pop. Overall one of the most overrated metroid-esque sidescrollers, and unless you were a huge mega fanboy of NES but hated Super Nintendo and everything after, I highly recommend passing on this or at least wait till it's PS+ Free.

What's not to like?\r But there's something else that defines a Minter game. And that's balance. Jeff groks games and he groks gamers. In Polybius, Llamasoft chucks a simple concept on the table, wraps it up in some gorgeous visuals, and  sprinkles some attractive gameplay over the top. You have fun. it draws you in.  On top of laughing in awe at the rush if the gfx, this thing is playable for the getgo. Then, bit by bit, the challenge is ramped up. Sometimes in some really subtle ways. Sometimes with a big lovely slap across the chops (flags, anyone?). And you die. But you always know why. And you try again. And you do a bit better. So you try again. And then, you realise you're past the pinch point. And he brings on the next. This is fantastically supported by the really simple and clever restart best system. Forge on, or rewind and give yourself a better start with more shields? Or a better score of you're leaderboard chasing.\r So you progress, and because the game's balance has educated you that with practice and patience, you will get further, you never feel like a wall has been shoved in front of you. and anyway, with a game as elegant as Polybius, failing has never been so much fun! Which moves us to the fact that this game fells like it has been designed to get you to the zone as quickly as possible. And, despite the speed and trips chaos, it's a remarkably relaxing experience. You get into a rhythm, a flow. It's llovely.\r So, a beautifully crafted game, both visually (obviously), but also more importantly from a gameplay/balance aspect.

                "review": "The Good\r The three new tables presented here are the same high quality that Zen has been making for years. They use original audio from the movies and game to bring you into each table, and it works great. Hearing the characters scream with dialogue from the movies and game makes you want to keep putting in more quarters start a new game each time you run out of balls.\r Each table has multiple missions to complete, and hidden areas that make standard tables inferior. I would love to see a real life table this complex.\r The Bad\r My only complaint, and this has been the case since the game was ported to the One, is that there is only one achievement per table, and each of the achievements are not something a beginner could do. I hope that for future tables they go back to 3 achievements per table, with varying degrees of difficulty.\r The Achievements\r With only one achievement per table, it may take players some time to unlock all three, as they require complex tasks, and require you to know your ramps and table locations.\r In the Aliens table, you must play on mission 3, Ulterior Motives, and defeat both Facehuggers. Luckily, you can enable mission select for the table, so as soon as you hit the mission marker you can select mission 3. Unfortunately, you only get one shot at it, and if you lose a ball, you will need to start the game over in order to select mission 3 again.\r The AvP table requires you to rank up. I wasn't able to unlock it during my playthroughs for my review, but it is probably the easiest of the 3. The final achievement is for performing 20 stealth takedowns on the Alien Isolation table, and I'm not sure what is required for this.\r I played each table for around an hour a piece, but wasn't able to unlock any achievements. With some practice, and maybe a guide, I can probably unlock them at a later point\r Final Verdict\r Other than the achievement complaint, these are solid tables for anyone that enjoys pinball, and especially for fans of the Alien franchise. I recommend this DLC and at $9.99, it is standard pricing for similar table packs. I look forward to the next high quality DLC from Zen Studios.",

It has all the songs from Diva F, Diva F2, Diva F X with all of the DLC from it as well. But thats not all.... it also includes all of the old psp Japanese diva songs that we never got here too. This is all included in the first half named future sound, 100 and something songs to enjoy. But yu should get the full version as well, as the other half includes all the songs from all the project miri games wich there is only 2 miri games anyways.... so the rest is filled with completely new songs that we probably haven't heard in the diva games. Oh did I forget to mention its only 56 dollars?  Honestly this port of future tone took me by complete suprise, I din't expect them to have it ported so quickly..... thank you developers for this holy game! With over 200 songs, it rival's final fantasy rythem game of 200+ songs wich Im still haven't heard all the songs yet after 3 months of playing it..... so you can imagine this rythem game is going to take you a very long time to play.... Im not going to say anything about gameplay because you can download project future tone for free on the playstation store with 2 free songs for you to enjoy... so you can make your own judgment by playing those 2 free songs first anyways. I will say that the graphics are super detailed. Most of the songs have the same old backdrops like in their original game, but here it looks 10x more impressive with the 3D model. Do note that all of the songs in the diva series are the short versions of the full song, with only the miri series to have the full versions of the songs. Don't worry though, none of them are terribly short.... they are long enough here. But what are you waiting for. Buy it already!",

My favorite songs are 1/6 Gravity, Dears, Though my songs has no form, Cat food .... etc so many good songs I can't write them all.. If you are into anime songs, Japanese songs. You should buy it. There is a trial version that you can download so check that out if you are unsure.",

This version of the game produced by J.A.W maintains what makes the original  a classic while adding several improvements that don't comprimise the creative vision that the original had. For example, the game has added versatility in its difficulty, allowing people who felt frustrated with the original enjoy the game. Controlling Abe feels diferent, it feels better, the controls seem to respond better, but there was no loss of the feeling that I controling a real person, or should I say, a real creature. Somehow they managed to find that perfect balance betwen responsive controls and the feel that i am controlling a real penson.This has always been one of the things I liked most about the  original games, the fact that you were controlling a real person, this combined with the extremely peculiar world that Lorne Lanning created passed that first positive first impression that the game provide, thats what called the player's attention. However, the appeal of the game went beyond that, it went far deeper, the game have excellent game mechanics and there's a sensational narrative, with several implied messages that can be reflected by the player, allowing him to take his own conclusions. More important than that is the fact that the gameplay is in total confluence with the story, it is totally different from modern games that compromise the story  just because shoot 'em in the head  is what sells,it isn't that game  that developers create a cgi scene there  they want you to care about the character, and when he gives you control of the character he send hordes of enemies for you to shoot , I don't see any person who can sympathize with a murderer. Any violence in oddworld, the creators can get away with it through irony. The gameplay isnt against the narrative, this is one of that special games that the gameplay doesnt work against the narrative, it works in favor of the narrative, making a emotional atachment with the player and the character of the game that few other mediums can achieve, its one of that special games that is very atmosferic.All the improvements help to create a more compealing atmosfere, the game looks more real than ever, the jump to 3D and no flipscreen help the game create a more cinematic feel ( sometimes the camera angles change ) . More important than ever is , despite being an all new game, this remake keeps what made the original apealing, it has its creative vision, it is a remake that remaster the classic to the 21st century. One of the things i absolute love about this game is the pace of it, it provides a nice challenge but at the same time it isnt that much that game that you are in constant battle and must have very fast reflexes, its a game that you can take your time, you have to be patient to be a good player, and the best thing is that because of the great controls i aways feel that i died because of me and not because of the game.",

The graphics, the controls, the game play, the puzzles, and especially the atmosphere. This remake is extremely surprising. It is the same game, but totally different. The controls, the level design, the game play mechanics. The game is like a completely new game. Which is a good thing. So if I were to mention what I loved about it, I would say that it has excellent controls, great level design, and is true to the original, yet offers something both fans, and new comers would enjoy. However, it does come with its own flaws. The Easy and Medium modes are WAY too easy (They even added a health bar). Some NPCs don't respond on time or get easily distracted (Happened to me once or twice, so it isn't that big of a deal). But the biggest complaint I have with it is that the atmosphere is completely gone. The game is now less creepy, and more comedic. The silly lines that Mudokens and Sligs mutter during game play are kinda annoying, and pretty loud. You can turn down the volume of voices, but still. I just love almost everything about this game, and would have given it a 9 or a 10, if it weren't for the atmosphere change. It felt less like an Oddworld, and more like a new game... But is that bad? Well... You decide. I am just providing my opinion.",

Controls have been switched around quite a bit from the original (mostly for the better) but overall control is less polished than the original. The biggest downside is the general unresponsiveness of the jump this time around - standing horizontal jumps are annoyingly sloppy having to press jump and then tilting right just after because tilting the left stick controls walk and run now based on the angle. Furthermore, there are several times when I have been shot by an enemy when I have been on a moving platform way out of the line of fire, and died. Also a couple of animations and sounds haven't made the jump the way to the new version! Most of these things can be fixed with updates, but still a really good game, just like it was in '97",

After hours of playing jumping still feels imprecise and I'm never quite 100% sure when to press \"x.\" Deactivating mines is always hit or miss and not often on the first try. The farting is just gross. While I enjoy challenging puzzles, some solutions are just too obtuse. If I pull a lever, I want to see what it did, not have to run around the stage and guess. Also, I feel punished for constantly choosing the \"wrong\" path. Is there an option to go back and attempt 100% on areas? Who knows. The game isn't very clear on this and a lot of things.

The real reason is that all of us are beta testers for the game until the final product is done. And beta test we did -- servers go down constantly, framerate hitches on PS4, audio mix is not good, animations are stiff, etc. This game is not fully cooked. Yet they have the audacity to put the game on sale for us to fix the game for them. That in itself deserves low stars.\r The other egregious thing that this game requires a constant online connection, for you to keep XP Progress, complete challenges, and gain unlocks like the sniper, remote bomb, etc. The game as it is offline, is super gimped, and a shallow husk of a game. For what purpose does this serve? To datamine player's activities? The only reasonable thing that requires online are the Contracts and Elusive Targets, but the single-player main campaign does not need this. This knocks this game down to 1 star automatically.\r Players and fans of HITMAN alike have protested this and they have not heard or made any changes to accommodate. So if that is the case, then I do not recommend this game to you my friend. Pass on it and don't allow developers and publishers to set a precedent for always-online Internet connection.",

                "review": "Revived my acct just to write this. PES has been my game since the PS2 days. I especially disliked FIFA 17, felt like a foosball game more than a football/soccer sim.  Furthermore, EA can eat my *** and if it went under I honestly wouldn't really mind. But this is the first Fifa I'm buying in over a decade because it's made enough improvements, especially on the controls & physics, to the point where all the other stuff like presentation, licenses, modes & graphics actually put it over for me.\r PES devs deserve the praise & cash after all these years (though they also deserve better than Konami as their boss...) but I find it pretty amazing that this is the year so many are finally flocking to it, after literally Decades of arguing with FIFA stans that EA's game was trash & that PES was where it's at. I'll admit even now, PES' classic feel on the controls cannot be beat.... But a football/soccer simulation that does not make. The truth is that PES has no midfield game. Matches are generally just 90 mins of counter attacks, through lobs to the wing, a flurry of shots, and repeat until the whistle blows. Any good PES player will churn out 25 shots per 10 minute game like clockwork and the only way to stop it isn't with actual defense on the field, but by memorizing defensive settings combos in the gameplan menu which apply the same to pretty much every team regardless of personnel & essentially functions as a game within a game. PES is fine, but PES is PES... It's got it's own rules & internal logic and if you abide by them, you'll have fun because it feels nice to play. But again, that doesn't make it a football/soccer simulation.\r I'm seeing a lot of people complain about FIFA's pace, but it is much more like the real thing. You actually have to think about how you're going to move the ball up the field & make the most of your possessions. There is actual incentive to pass Backwards sometimes, like in real life, to reset play... Try that in PES in a competitive game, I dare you (you'll have it snatched from behind by the opposing striker and give up a goal). There are different ways to approach offense unlike in PES where every good player sets the same 3 FWD formation regardless of the personnel because they know the game is so heavily offensive that playing any other way is pointless. In FIFA you can actually play team defense based on field positioning instead of feeling like you're skating on ice with no choice but to try to steal the ball 1 on 1, at which point it's off to the races again. If all this makes FIFA \"too slow\" for people then I really have to question those people's understanding of the sport.\r None of this would mean as much to me if the game didn't feel right on the controls, which is exactly why I've stuck it out with PES & dealt with all the BS (like bad servers & lack of licenses, uploading kits & stadiums & all that) for all these years. There is no doubt that the physics & feel have finally improved to the point where it's a no brainer for me. And while the controls may not be as loose & Mario-like as PES, it's certainly better than any FIFA in a long time, especially last year's where it felt like all the players were puppets connected by string. This time passing & dribbling do feel nice and individual players off the ball actually move around in a more realistic way, unlike any other Fifa or PES I've seen, which seemed robotic when you look at them from a distance. If you don't believe me check out the demo & play it for yourself.\r I have yet to get into all the different modes but from what I've seen from FUT it is nice and let me tell you the licenses, presentation & feeling of real life connectedness with sport globally do not hurt, especially after all these years of PES. If I come across any tragic gamebreaking circumstances I will come back and change this review, but until then I'm leaving a 10 because all these 0's, 1's & 2's are a joke and need some balancing out. My only real concern at this point is that I haven't exactly found the right difficulty setting, though I've settled on Pro for now (1 higher than the default Semi-Pro) and it generally feels right.",

El modo camino a mejorado mucho y nos da una historia bastante entretenida, que simula bien al de un futbolista real. El modo carrera ha mejorado un poco gracias a las cinemáticas cuando fichamos a alguien o cuando hacemos un fichaje poner un gif de la rueda de prensa del jugador que has fichado.\r MALO: La defensa ha empeorado, se adelanta mucho las líneas y aunque pongas poner el autobús, igualmente se adelantan mucho y esto provoca que te puedan ganar muchas veces las espaldas.\rNo hay suficientes estadios, la liga española es un ejemplo, solo está el Santiago Bernabéu y el Wanda Metropolitano. Se que el FCBarcelona no tiene el camp nou por derechos, pero el San Mamés?? Sanchez Pijuan??? o el Mestalla??? estadios europeos que no están en este fifa y encima que tiene la licencia de la LaLiga Santander. El camino tiene cosas buenas, pero, también cosas malas. El camino dispone de solo 6 equipos para que el jugador que controles (Alex Hunter) pueda jugar, quiero decir que solo puede jugar en esos equipos, y no dispone de más. Tiene una apartado de personalización muy limitado.\r Conclusión: Si amas el fútbol como yo este juego te puede gustar, ahora bien si eres una persona que solo juega por jugar, este juego no te va gustar. Mi opinión es que me ha encantado como está vivo los estadios y también los marcadores de las ligas oficiales....hasta ahí bien, pero a la hora de jugar es un poco mierda...como defender en este fifa es una porquería y hay jugadores que tienen una media super alta y son unos jugadores que no son para tanto, y jugadores que son geniales en la realidad y le ponen medias super bajas. También quiero dejar claro que este juego hay equipos muy chetados, pero hay uno en especial que es Real Madrid. En mi opinión me está bien que porqué la temporada pasada han ganado casi todo los jugadores sean mejorados, pero no tenían que haber puesto que si un jugador es lento como el Nacho en la realidad, gane en el fifa a un felipe luis, y cristiano porque sea la portada no tiene que ser más bueno que messi, y hablando de messi en este fifa es más surrealista, no puede ser que solo regate a uno y despues ya esta no puede regatear mas o que un medio que no tiene nada de fuerza, le gana en cuerpo, es como el cristiano también es surrealista pero a lo bueno, es decir esta chetado los tiros,los regates,fuerza y ha messi nada le bajan, y también pierde muchos balones, es increíble. El camino me a gustado es muy interactivo aunque solo sean 6 equipos pero te pones la piel de un futbolista y si te gusta el futbol te gustara mucho, aparte que también se puede personalizar a Alex Hunter. El modo carrera también a mejorado por el aspecto de poner cinemáticas, lo hace mas realista, pero necesita más personalización. Online tambien es muy vicioso, pero ultimate team no a cambiado mucho es lo mismo que el año, pero bueno si funciona se puede dejar tal y como esta, pero aun sigue con el mercado de fifa points, me da una rabia ahora estos años de videojuegos que pongas micropagos a juegos....la industria se va a la mierda....\r bueno en conclusión no es recomendado a los que solo juega por jugar.\rNo estamos a un fifa de la ostia, le falta personalización, mejora de la defensa, mejora del camino, i ser mas realista con jugadores",

(But new players might want to go through some plots/summaries on youtube before diving in). But I must say I am a bit disappointed after completing the game. By completing, I mean getting all trophies. I am still craving for more contents. At the end, I still think it is a step down from KH2.\r Pros:\r- nice graphics ( Imo, this isn't necessary for a great game but surely add points )\r- great OST\r- easy and fluid combat for everyone at different age to enjoy the story\r- story progression ( Xehanort line done, I guess )\r- lots of mini games, ( diversity of gameplay?, good for a change of pace/mood )\r- space exploration for gummy ship , creative gummy ship editing\r- less grinding than before, easy money, easy xp, easy ultima weapon. (hardest part was to grind ingredients for synthesizing all stuff)\r- got to be the captain of the Black Pearl and sail in open sea\r Cons:\r- less worlds in total, worlds are small as in areas\r- easy combat even in proud mode\r- mini games are not that interesting, if not for getting Ultima weapon, I wouldn't bother to play a second time\r- Sora is like a bystander in most of the worlds, without much interactions with local characters and without involving in the original stories\r- no FF characters\r- unsatisfying last boss fight. not cool, not grand, not exciting, feels like a drag-on cut scene. Xehanort doen't look like a last boss, his attacks/skills doesn't match his power, pretty easy to dodge/guard. Got a feeling of \"that's it?\" after beating him. Actually waiting for his \"3rd\" form/fight at the first time but all I got was an ending. Can't compare to the epic boss fight in KH2. The laser blocking was tense as hell.\r- rubbish \"secret\" boss. It is not secret at all. It is not even strong. All 3 phases are basically the same animations and skills. Finish the fight even quicker than Xehanort. Give me back my Sephiroth in KH2.\r- Hearts-ception. hearts , hearts every where. hearts within hearts within hearts.\r Let me elaborate more on my points.\r Combat:\rI feel like it is concentrated on visual effects and fast pace rather than on the feeling of \"hitting something\" or \"hitting hard\". Sure, the attack animations are fluid, fast, flashy, colourful, massive aoe when doing pole dance. Most of the time, Sora's motion is unaffected/unhindered by how heavy the monsters are. It feels like going into a group of monsters hitting nothing but air. Not to mention the knock backs on both enemies and Sora are still fake af with them kind of floating backwards at a slow speed.\rThe situational commands (ie triangle) are alright i guess. The form change? Nice to be powered up and have a different combo and finisher. The grand magics? I love them. They are kinda cool. The \"rides\"? If the cut scenes can be skipped, that would be nice. They are nice to look for a few times but they got annoying real quick. And you sometimes take damage from monsters in the rides. So I either don't use them at all, or quickly trigger the finisher right after I started them.\rThe combat is just so easy (no lv lock of course)that you can keep pressing X through the whole game without problem. I am not asking for some dark souls level combat with stamina bar and recovery time management. But there is almost no technique involve in fights. I don't know, maybe some monsters can only be damage by counter attack? or magic? maybe can only be killed if Sora bait out some move? I know there are big fat guys with shield belly which can only be X at the back but that's about it. I can X X X X through everything else. Overall feels like a over simplify Disney version of devil may cry.\r Maps:\rThere are like 9 worlds? too little man, just too little. Most of the worlds are too small in size as well. The representative must be winnie the pooh world. Basically 3 mini games in a room. Winnie the pooh story is also coming out of nowhere and also finish very suddenly. The big hero 6 world is like a garage base and a big empty city. You have nothing to do on streets during main story. There is nothing to really interact, NPCs are doing NPCs stuff without giving a single fk about you. If I am not going treasure hunting, I will not have the chance to appreciate the work they have put into the city buildings. The twilight town is small. I love Jack Sparrow's world tho. And if you have watched them Disney films before, correct me if I am wrong, Sora have no effects on the stories whatsoever.\r Story:\rMostly \"I have friends, our hearts are connected together. You lonely loser, fk you.\" The conspiracy from Xehanort, which should kind of linking up all KH series so far, turns out to be a really simple one. \"The world is tainted, I want a reset.\" - Xehanort.

This game is the worst in the entire series. Even if you're a fan, I wouldn't recommend playing this game. Skip it. The story pretty much ended at Kingdom Hearts 2 anyway. There's nothing that this game offers that ends up being meaningful or important to the lore. The story doesn't even begin until you're about 80% of the way through the game, and you have to suffer through hours of nonsensical Disney slop before getting to the actual Kingdom Hearts story.

It looked interesting so I figured that I would give it a try.  In my 30+ years of gaming, this is hands down the most beautifully stunning game that I have ever seen.  The lighting and visuals are absolutely breathtaking.  It looks like you are looking at some kind of wonderful live painting.  The colors are so unique and vivid that it just comes to life off of your screen.  And the amount of sheer detail in these environments is just mindblowing.  I am constantly stopping just to look around and try to see all that there is to see.  Even though it's a 2d side scroller, it must be rendered in 3d.  The depth of the backgrounds is incredible and there is constantly something going on in the background at all times.  I found myself always wanting to journey INTO the scenes, instead of just ACROSS the scenes because of the amount of depth and detail in the background.  You honestly cannot see everything because there is just too much.  My wife, who cares 0.0% about video games, was sitting in the room with me last night while I was playing.  Now she has seen bits and pieces of every game that I have played in the past 10 years just from walking through the room while I have been playing and glancing at the screen.  But she has never stopped to look at a game ever.  Last night she was like \"Oh my god, what is this game?  It's absolutely beautiful!\"  And I have not even touched on the gameplay yet which is addictively fun.  The character models look amazing, the physics are top notch, and the music draws you right into it's fantasy world.  If you are even remotely considering this game, do not wait for one more second... get Trine right now.  I cannot wait to get home tonight to play it again.",

Well for sure the best graphics in the series, but the gameplay got dumbed down a lot. First, the secrets (chests) are completely pointless. In Trine 1 there were artifacts hidden in chests that gave us certain advantages in the game... here these chests are filled with SH**TY poems or lame concept arts... what a waste. The bigger waste is removal of the artifacts. You know what else is gone? The great triangle that the sorcerer could spawn in Trine 1... yep it's gone. Instead Zoya got a blue arrow that creates a bubble that slows everything. And this is actually the core of the game... almost all of the puzzles are solved with the blue arrow and it's a real shame, because the first part had some diversity, but nope it's the blue arrow here! Also, because Trine 1 was not a long game, the developers decided to make Trine 2 harder... so it would take us longer to beat it, which is a disgrace. I finished Trine 1 on hard with hardcore mode on and had great time, but here this kind of difficulty is a bloody mess... better play it on normal. And that's mostly all the negative things I can say about Trine 2.

It adds even more depth to an already wonderful game.\r The one criticism I've heard is that AC Origins wishes it was the Witcher 3. Well, The Witcher 3 is probably my favorite game of all time. When it came out we saw article after article about how it was becoming the gold standard for open world adventure games. Why shouldn't AC Origins have taken notes and followed a similar formula? That's what a standard means. I think it worked out fantastically too. Honestly, I couldn't give a rat's behind if we saw more open world adventure games done in this style.

The endgame is also awesome where you fight enemies three levels above the maximum level of the character, meaning a challenge is imminent.\r The length and story was a lot of fun and Ubisoft is showing some strong performances with ACO DLC's. My only issue was the lack of closure which is reflected in the end of the story here. It doesn't seem to tie into the main story like the last DLC. Another issue was the roaming enemies were just randoms that didn't tie into a side quest, which was a missed chance.\r I strongly recommend this DLC to anyone that enjoyed ACO and has tried the first DLC.

However Ninja theory decided to listen to some fan feedback and made some technical improvements to the package. The storyline is pretty much the same with the exception of a new cutscene which tries to explain why Vergil killed Lilith and Mundus spawn but the extra cutscene gives little more of a throwaway line than an actual expansion. One thing that I did forget to mention in my last review of when the game first launched was the humor. It is low brow but I would be lying if I said I didn't chuckle with some of new Dante's sarcasm. The social commentary is mixed since it is obvious that it does have a heavy emphasis on liberal ideology but there is also some profound statements as well although they do fall into the trap of being cliched. This game will not only anger fans of the original game but it will also anger those who probably follow on the right side of the political scale (That is not the case for me because I admittedly have a few liberal biases).\rGame Play:\rOne of the problems with the first release was that it only ran at 30fps. Thankfully this version of the game has increased to 60 fps which makes the combat far more responsive. They even added a lock on system to make it much easier to hit the enemy that you want to hit. The color coding is no longer required but to maintain your combos but it still shows its presence by hitting the right colored enemy with the right colored weapon though.It should be commened that Ninja thoery tried to fix one of the many complaints but it more like puting on  a band aid than an actually lean up. For those who thought the first release was rundown Devil May Cry game this package does contain hardcore mode which does make it feel more like a traditional Devil May Cry experience. Especially on higher difficulties it could create some intense battles which could keep you on the edge of your toes. If you are willing to give the game anther chance it could give you what you are looking for in a mechanic sense, but if you are a purist of the series than the definitive edition will not change your mind.",

Between the story, item world and the ability to power up enemies and your characters to insane levels the game play options are vast. The game obviously is not perfect, some of the battles are difficulty not because of the enemies but because of their seemingly careless design and at times the dialogue can be exceptionally corny.

                "review": "Let me start by saying that Disgaea 1 Complete is probably my least favorite iteration of the game, even though they've had every chance of improving upon the game in so many ways. Compared to the newer titles in the series, Disgaea 1 has some very dated mechanics that feel clunky and are not very intuitive, and most of these remain unaltered in D1C, for better or for worse.\r This is one of the areas where I feel like implementing some of the improvements from the newer titles would have helped, but I guess you could argue that they wanted to keep the original experience intact, except they have made so many lazy changes to the various sprites of both humanoid and monster classes, as well as weapon models, that it barely feels like the same game anymore.\r For example, instead of manticores we now have skeletal dragons, yet they are still called manticores in the game... They also changed the thief class from the old male version to the newer female catgirl type. Brawlers, mages, and many of the monster classes are completely changed, just because they chose to copy/paste the sprites from the newer titles instead of making HD versions of the original designs. I wouldn't be so bothered by this if we could at least choose to play with the original graphics, but that's not an option.\r It may seem like nitpicking, but the old character/monster designs is one of the defining features of the original game, and with all the lazy copy/pasting, this game feels more like a quick cashgrab rather than a remaster, and it definitely doesn't feel like the definitive version of anything.\r At least there's one big improvement over the original game, namely the ability to skip skill animations, although it has to be toggled on or off in the options, you can't simply press or hold a button whenever you want to skip something. There's also a dialogue skip feature which I don't believe was present in the original (holding R2 to quickly skip).\r It's an OK game overall, but since you'd be so much better off with the PC version (in my opinion), you might as well get that one instead, unless you don't mind all of the changes.",

Goalkeepers when facing an easy ball, they act like they are drunk and I really mean it. An opponent manages to receive a cross in 5 yard box, and then we have a goalkeeper being late when holding triangle button, or even the opponent receives the ball on chest and is about to perform a volley shot, well GK can do whatever, but he chooses to wait for the volley - happens a lot (to add players also wait for that volley as well, where the logic would be they run over this player who is receiving the ball on chest instead of head shooting or passing). Shooting, powerful shots especially from shorter distances like 10-12yards, GK defends without a problem; while on the contrary we have head shots from 5-8yards distances that are slow, too slow - this is where is drunk GKs - they can catch the ball without a problem but hey this doesn't happen, goal usually happens.\r **In-match replays - they show you a replay for every boring, unimportant stuff that happens, they also don't offer you feature which would turn those unnecessary replays off or at least a quick skip option, and yes that press OPTIONS button is too slow for me\r **Player AI - it is what it is, not to happy about it but not disappointed at the same time\r **Game updates - while those are great, whenever being in main menu and going around it, it always checks for updates and tests network environment, its completely unnecessary and it makes the game slow\r Thats all.",

Now you have Blackout mode (which most people are buying this for) and if you watch reviews or streams and think that this is the type of game that can be interesting for a long time to come then good for you. However, many many people who have played a Battle Royale game have seen it all. Injecting a bit of fan service will not sustain this game very long because the core fundamentals are boring. There is no skill ceiling worth attaining and even assists count as kills in multiplayer - yes everyone is a winner now.  Now you can be a big winner and spend some of those COD points before buying more microtransactions. Removing the single player is just part of a larger anti-consumer trend and the brilliant part is that the consumers will be the ones defending their purchases saying \"it's not that bad\" or \"there are worse games\" etc etc. And the trend continues.",

It's fine for nostalgia to toss in a few, but every class from Black Ops 3 is back, and maps from Black Ops and Black Ops 2 appear in the NORMAL playlists. It's down right lazy.\r Not to mention the fact there is no single-player campaign or loot system (CoD WWII). It seems the only reason this game was even released was for the Battle Royale mode.

I purchased this game because there were limited options of games I wanted for the Playstation 4.  With that said, I've really enjoyed this game.  It really taps into the power of the Playstation 4 and shows it well.  The graphics are extremely impressive!  Whether it be in a settlement or a deserted island, it appears to be very realistic in many different ways.  The way the water moves, storms that you can get caught in, weather changes, it's all very surreal to watch.  The combat system is basically the same as the previous version, it works very well.

This slowed the game down drastically, so i decided to mainly focus on the story and the momentum built right back up.\r Overall: High fun factor, movement is still heavy/clunky and there is plenty to do/explore.

I felt as well there wasn't much gameplay to it, you just click a button and hope for the best unlike steamworld heist where you have to manually aim, so it involves you more. And there isn't much variation to the game, within 2 hours i'd pretty much seen all it had to offer. The stress mechanic is a novel idea but it goes up way too fast. The level design was cool at first but then after awhile each corridor and room looked the same.

Resident Evil has become so bloated in its sequels and spin offs, all of them underwhelming, that revisiting Spencer Mansion for the third time is sadly a breath of fresh air. Nevertheless, it is a welcomed breath of fresh air as we now have the best Resident Evil in some years. Leave it to a polished up version of a 2002 Gamecube release, which in itself was a remake of the original 1996 release of Resident Evil's starting point, to put smiles on the faces of all the devoted old school fans who have wanted the series to return to its terrifying albeit cheesy and clunky roots. Capcom achieves greatness with making the arguably best even better by tidying up the controls, graphics, textures and sound, and letting it live and breath on current generation consoles. Those who only know modern Resident Evil, or never got to play this in 2002 entry have themselves a fantastic experience ahead of them as they explore Spencer Mansion and witness the groundbreaking horror first hand with the original core characters. This game doubles as a grocery list of what Survival Horror should be, and how the modern conveniences of gaming do not always make for the best experience. This take on Resident Evil is both familiar and curious, both comfortable and nerve racking, and both full of nostalgia and yet as challenging as a never before seen adventure. So those of you who have played the original '96 game, are still in for surprises around some corners, and challenges that will make resources vital. The dialogue, though still a bit cheesy, is multiple levels up from that of the delightfully awkward original script. It remains similar enough to bring back all the memories of the original, but separates itself enough from the past to intrigue, creating an almost parallel world experience with how similar but more thought out the new dialogue is. I found myself both listening to the new, but in my head quoting the old, making for some laughs. Once again, those first person views of doors opening, tight corridors with the moaning undead near by, and limping through halls praying for ammo and health all have your hair on end, and it is a most welcome return. The Mansion is only slightly redesigned enough to make you lull into comfort, thinking you have the situation under control before springing something new on you such as a new zombie placement, or unfamiliar room, or retelling an old experience in less predictably ways. The results are fun and frightening. The Mansion is alive with creaks and shutters, moving light and flashes of lighting, shadows and mirrors, fog and water, all pulling you in deeper than ever before. This is Resident Evil in all its Survival Horror glory. It would be impossible to rate this any lower than a perfect score, seeing as it is a better version of a past masterpiece, and then improved once again on top of that. Get lost in Spencer Mansion, and take a bloody bite out of the game that started it all, the one and only, Resident Evil.",

If you don't appreciate it, either you are not meant for the genre OR you are a stooge born circa 1995+ and you don't know any better!!\r The downside to this game is when I compared it to RE2...\r There was WAAY too much backtracking.  (it was excessively done) due to 6 slot inventory system which becomes tiresome when every new area you discover...you realise your gonna have to run back.\r My other negative is the multiple ending attempt... its GARBAGE.  Unless you enjoy playing a game and cheating + Walkthrough... you aren't going to see the REAL ending... this is HORRIBLE! IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF PLAYING THIS KIND OF GAME, YOUR FORCED TO KILL ANY SURPRISE BY USING A WALKTHROUGH IN ORDER TO REACH THE DESIRED ENDING.\r((I got the crap ending which was absolutely horrible because I refused to google search when i was stuck in the game ))\rThat's the only reason I removed 1 pts.....\r Other than that",

This is something the game does not tell you as when you have completed a chapter you start from scratch losing all your recipes and items and moving to a different region. I spent many hours just building crazy things and fortifying my first city just to lose it all when I went to another region. Although I did have fun building the stuff so thats what matters.\r Overall, the game is fun with comical story elements and lighthearted visuals. Gathering resources and building fortifications and gear/weapons to defend your town s from invading monsters is really fun. A hidden gem that not many people know about in the PS4 community.

You will need to plan out your attacks and make strategies.\r The music of Transistor is so amazing that it is a must that you listen to the whole OST. Ashley Barrett's vocals are haunting, but so beautiful at the same time that you get lost while playing into the music. It's just that amazing.\r The story is Transistor's weak spot.

                "review": "I was really disappointed by this game. I played Bastion because it was on sale, and fell so deeply in love with is that I bought Transistor at full price even though Im flat broke just because I had so much faith in Super Giant Games. But the two games couldnt be more different. Transistor just doesnt have that exciting feel to it that Bastion had. I found myself in agony wishing the 1000th battle would be over already. A feeling I never once felt during their last game. Theres just to much of the same old thing over and over again. And the combat system is interesting in theory, but is terrible in practice. Freezing time is cool, until its over. For people who are fans of the combat system, please sit down and think about this: The process you (pretty much) have to go through to defeat enemies results in you being completely vulnerable for what seems like an eternity in a field of enemies that are faster than you can run away from. The only options you have to defend yourself at this point are A. Jaunt(), which really cripples you if you have to give it a whole attack slot for the entire game. B. One solitary attack that you can use while recharging if you attach Jaunt to it (which of course often means that attack will be the first one you lose through overload) or C. have a dog with you. Thats it. Doing the thing I basically couldnt win without, the main aspect of the combat system, made me feel like I was being punished. There are many video games that will, for example, give you a powerful machine gun that will over heat and be unusable for a bit if you use it too long in one go. But theres a way to avoid it. always. But theres no way to avoid it in Transistor. The combat system is terrible. The only thing worse than that was losing your attacks. Really? They probably picked the single worst punishment for dying in the history of video games: you get to keep fighting, but were taking your best weapon. And even if you win, youre not getting it back for a long while. I would rather go back to my last save point every time I died. That would have been much less frustrating. And again, maybe this would have been better if they used it better. But with the way the time stop system is set up, you can only win by exposing yourself to long periods of defenselessness, and theres no way to restore health other than some terrible health regenerating abilities. So by doing what the game wants you to do, you will inevitably lose your best weapon, and not even have it for the next battle either. And the battles just got so repetitive and boring. Stop time, run behind, use crash, then spam your strongest thing. then run and take as little damage as you can in the recharge period. Repeat. They added nothing really new. New functions maybe. Although it seemed like they actually came up with the functions in the order you receive them in-game, because they ideas kept becoming less and less creative as it wore on and on. Ugh. In Bastion, almost every level had something totally new. A new enemy that did something no enemy before it had done. A new totally unique weapon that was tailored to that levels challenges. But no. Transistor was the same old cybernetic city that then became even more boring whitewashed cybernetic city. The story was nonexistent. I get being subtle, and I love when games are like that. But on one hand, theres dark souls, where the main aspect of the game is the challenge, and the story is completely inconsequential. If you dont want to go out of your way to find it, no big deal. Then theres transistor. A game that is clearly trying so hard to get me engrossed in the games story and become emotionally attached to the characters, and yet refuses to tell me anything about them. Its infuriating. Bastion was somewhat similar, but it wasnt as bad. Its like between making Bastion and Transistor, SuperGiant Games quite literally got a serious allergy to telling the player anything directly whatsoever. And Bastion was simpler. There was a great disaster. the world is falling apart. we need to gather stuff to power this safe haven so we can be safe/fix this. Did I know everything? No. Did I know enough? Yes. In Transistor there was not one point where I had any idea what was happening. They threw around the word Carmanata every 3 seconds without ever telling me what that meant. Were they a radical group? A group of higherups gone rouge? Did two of the four final bosses really kill themselves before I got to them? Why is the city turning white? is there normally giant bone whale beasts flying around? I dont know enough about this universe to be surprised by that. Why could Red just fix everything so easily at the end? Why didnt she try that earlier? Why were they kidnapping famous people? that was never explained? Not to mention the music was awful. Probably one memorable track in this game. I know Bastions track was hard to live up to but come on. Also Royces voice made me want to kill myself.",

I was curious as to how that would be handled and I thought that a spectacular job was done. Sub-stories are more immersive as they blend into cutscenes now and feel like its own story. I love the new Clan Creator simulation, which is a fighting manager with a Yakuza Family hierarchy. You can recruit characters in the Yakuza universe and even people off the street to create a powerful organization to neutralize bad actors. It is innovative because it has a great storyline and had me spend several hours on this alone.\r Character development was well done, motives were justified and the near-complete focus on Kiryu makes perfect sense here since this is the last time we play as the Dragon of Dojima. Gameplay mechanics have changed and I like the changes because it helps the game feel fresh and new.\r My only gripe with this game is that frames go slow-mo sometimes and it runs on 30fps. I never really paid attention to it as I was so engrossed in the game itself.\r What really impressed me was how Kamurocho was realized in this game. By contrast to the bustling Tokyo city, Onomichi has a small town traditional setting based in Hiroshima. This juxtaposition helped me appreciate the game even more. I was also very impressed by the new heat actions which I found extremely cool.\r I would recommend this game as a must-play for Yakuza veterans and newcomers. I would implore new-comers to try Yakuza 0 and Kiwami before getting into this for an enhanced experience. Yakuza 6 is not only one of the best entries in the series but one of the best experiences this year. 9.5/10.",

After more than a year and a half, Yakuza 6 was finally released in Europe.\r Yakuza 6 is great! I like everything in this game! With the new Dragon Engine, Kamurocho looks the best so far. Now Kamurocho is really more realistic, actually, it looks like you're in real Kabukicho (part of Tokyo on which Kamurocho is based). Battle system is excellent. The fighting is similar to the first five Yakuza games (1-5), no more fighting styles like in Yakuza Zero and Kiwami. I play Yakuza games since 2006, so I prefer the battle system from Yakuza 1-5 and I'm glad they continued with a similar system in Yakuza 6. There are many interesting things you can do in Kamurocho and Onomichi. I always enjoyed in all the minigames that appeared in Yakuza games. I could spend hours just having fun with the minigames in Yakuza games and that's one of the reasons why I like this franchise. Also the story of this game is very good and interesting. Unfortunately this is the last chapter of my favorite character in video games. I enjoyed playing all seven stories (Yakuza Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) of Kazuma Kiryu, and Yakuza 6 gives an excellent conclusion to his story. Of course Yakuza games does not end up with Kazuma Kiryu: SEGA has already announced a new game in series (Shin Ryū ga Gotoku) with a new main character, but at the moment I'm most interested in spin-off Hokuto ga Gotoku (based on the series Fist of the North Star) that will be released before the new Yakuza game.\r Also I want to add: I hope SEGA will make a remake of Yakuza 3, 4 and 5 for PS4 after Kiwami 2.

                "review": "More like 9.5 than 10.\r Yakuza 6: The Song of Life is the last game in the Yakuza series, but not the last in terms of quality; far from it. My knowledge of this series already comes from Yakuza 4, which came out in PS Plus in February 2015 and from there I was completely addicted and aware of the upcoming Yakuza that were to come at that time, namely Yakuza 5, Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami. As in previous games, Yakuza 6 is an action-adventure game that mixes brawler style combat with RPG elements. And again we have the protagonist, the 4th Chairman, that is, Kazuma Kiryu.\r When I returned to Kamurocho, I soon noticed that it was visually amazing and the same goes for the city Onomichi, who is also present in the game. Now we will not have loadings of 1 second, each time we enter or leave a restaurant for example. Whenever we come into conflict with some ruffians on the streets, the city itself \"becomes a battle arena\" (and still we can escape successfully), unlike the previous ones where we were limited to a small place. Yes, we can also take and fight the ruffians in places like Poppos or on Smile Burger. The spectacle of all this is to see smashed glasses, objects flying and as result, the employee expels us and the site is temporarily closed for repairs. It's these little details that make me delight in this Yakuza 6: The Song of Life.\r But you may be wondering, what has really changed in the gameplay over Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami? A lot of things. The Brawler and Rush styles were eliminated, with only Beast (when we entered Extreme Heat Mode) and Dragon remaining and still have their differences. In Beast we don't have those slow movements anymore and in Dragon, the moveset is different from the previous Yakuzas. Each time we win a battle or eat something, we are rewarded with experience points for 5 abilities: Strength, Agility, Spirit, Technique and Charm, which can be used to increase Kiryu's stats (Health, Attack, Defense, Evasion, Heat Gauge) and to buy Battle Skills, Heat Actions and other skills.\r What I really have to say about the gameplay of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life is that I feel the character's moves and the blows are smooth, frantic, and full of strength. It is true that at the beginning we are taking a lot of kicks when we are facing many ruffians, triads or yakuzas, but it is because we are limited to a one quickstep (there are double and triple) and the fact that we don't have the quickstep cancel. It's always rewarding to see our enemies taking with a Heat Action, some of theme are hilarious. An example of this is the Essence of Electromagnetic Torture, which consists to shoot the enemy at the microwave and asking the employee to \"warm\" the head of our enemy. Another example, the Essence of Knock Out Punch, allows us to see (through a 1 second Slow Motion) our enemy spitting blood whenever we punch him in the chin. In comparison to the previous ones, we don't have some old Heat Actions, but we have many new ones.\r In this Yakuza 6: The Song of Life we have something new called Clan Creator. Let's say it's a kind of Fighting Manager, in which we have a hierarchy (Chairman> Captain> Lieutenant> Soldier) to organize, take them to the missions and fight against other clans. Correct, if we want a soldier for our clan, sometimes we will have to search in the streets of Onomichi and defeat this person in a fight. They all have different moves, weapons, punches and some characters have special moves. And yes, we can also take our team to the online battles.\r As always, this Yakuza 6 also features the usual Yoshida Batting Center, Hostess Clubs, Substories and Mahjong, but new things have also been added, such as hunting fish, octopuses and sharks in the waters of Onomichi, a site called RIZAP Kamurocho to exercise our muscles and improve our character's physique, and we even have to rescue lost cats, which we then send to the Nyan Nyan Café. In addition, there are also Vending Machines, which help to temporarily increase our stats and the missions or the help requests to rescue someone who is having trouble with ruffians, for example. And, of course, the Sega Club is also present in this Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, and we have games like Virtual Fighter 5: Final Showdown and even classics such as Out Run, Puyo Puyo, Super Hang-On, Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier.\r Despite all of this, i miss the mini-games like Bowling, Pool, gambling and fights in the Purgatory Coliseum. Fights against bosses are challenging, with a phenomenal soundtrack and feature breathtaking scenes. SEGA has done a almost perfect work by keeping the style that made this series unique, but at the same time make some changes so that the game and series stay fresh. Yakuza 6: The Song of Life is not only one of the best entries in the series, but also one of the best experience of 2018 so far.",

                "review": "Yakuza 6 is an excellent game. It offers a wealth of activities that have brought me to pop in the disc months after beating it to just take in some more of Kamurocho and Onomichi.\r Since there are very few, let's get the negatives out of the way: There is a segment where you are tasked with retrieving formula for baby food with the child in tow and this naturally means an intrusive and annoying minigame at frequent intervals during this time. The game has loads of fun stuff to do on the side, but once you've done it all, there's not a whole lot to come back for- the karaoke only has a few songs, darts is... well, darts, the Sega arcades have a few classic retro titles, and the cat cafe takes all of 4 seconds to interact with once you've collected them all. There are a few minigames that are substantial, as opposed to the earlier mentions, but once you get through them you likely won't return. These things reveal the nature of the minigames within- they're all just a bit too small to really rope you in for long, so while I'll pop the disc in for a mini vacation, it only ever lasts an hour or two and then it's back to the box for a few more months. That's it, all the bad!\r Yakuza 6 hits those classic satisfying franchise points like heavy and emotional drama, wild flair and style, and pulse-pounding action all wrapped neatly within a mystery. As the definitive ending to our main character's story, Yakuza 6 provides a resolution that most long time franchise fans will find satisfying, though a few like myself will find the very last moments a bit cliche. The game comes very close to perfection but only slightly misses the mark and that is why I rate Yakuza 6 a near-perfect 9/10. Yakuza 6 is playable as a newcomer, but it is not recommended as a lot of context will be missing and this world deserves to be as fleshed out as previous titles make it. If you are unfamiliar with the franchise, go pick up 0 and Kiwami and work your way up to 6, but if you are familiar with the franchise, buy this game immediately as it is worth every cent.",

Why do most people give every game either 0 or 10 is beyond my comprehension...\r In any event, I gave this game an 8 because it's a really good game. I think it falls just shy of greatness, which it does achieve in its storytelling.\r There are many substories and mini-games to keep you playing. Not the least of which is the karaoke (the song Today is a Diamond may be the best in the entire franchise).\r But being the game that follows Yakuza 0, meeting expectations can't be easy. I really enjoyed the game. But Yakuza 0 is one of the most complete games I've ever played, and one of very few I gave a 10 rating to.\r Still, Yakuza 6 is worth any gamer's time. But if you haven't played any entry in the series yet, save 6 for later and play Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami instead (also Kiwami 2 comes out in Aug. 2018 ). How can you appreciate the final chapter in Kazuma Kiryu's story if you're not familiar with the previous ones?\r Yakuza 6 has superior graphics, but it also refers to back stories. And because these games are heavily invested in above-average storytelling, you might as well start from the beginning.",

I know that is a bold statement, but never has there been a game that I bought for 3 separate consoles (Xbox 360, Steam and PS4) and played all the way through on each one like there was no tomorrow.\r The game starts out as a 2D Mindcraft-esque sandbox explorer, but slowly evolves into an insanely in depth platform adventure/shooter with by far the most expansive crafting system in existence thus far. The amount of materials that exist to build and construct with honestly seems infinite. In all of my 3 playthroughs, I still don't think I've seen every item. The game's item count is in the 2 or 3 thousands and they are still adding new things. The weaponry, accessory and clothing options are vast, with hundreds of ways to customize your character and the abilities that help you play the game. My best strategy to play the overall game is to first set up a base with dorms for NPCs up above, then a basement/dungeon with all the crafting stations and inventory chests below, and under that a tunnel straight down to hell. You will find endless things to do along the way, having over 100 hours of exploring within each of the 10+ worlds you can randomly generate. With the ability to delete and re-create worlds at will, there is no limit to how much you can collect and build.\r I think this may also be one of the most challenging gaming experiences I have ever undertaken. There are boss battles that require intense preparation. In Terraria, that preparation could include gathering materials, brewing potions, constructing your own arena that helps you fight the boss to your liking, building a house and setting up a nurse near the boss arena so she can heal you during the fight, etc. There are so many ways to go about achieving your goals. Not only are the items vast, but the best part about the game is that the environment is completely manipulatable. There is nothing you can't build, and nothing you can't destroy.\r Terraria is a massive achievement from such a small team of developers. It's almost impossible to describe, but I guess one could say it resembles Mindcraft meets Castlevania meets Zelda meets...something way better than all of those games combined.
